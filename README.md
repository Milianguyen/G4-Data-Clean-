# Predicting Movie Revenue Through Social Sentiment (Word of Mouth)

This GitHub repo contains the final model code + final training/testing datasets for Group 4's final project in CAP4773 (Spring 2025) at USF Tampa.

The Final_Model.ipynb file contains all of the code used to train and test our model as well as comments to explain steps. The testing and training sets should be loaded in the same folder as the .ipynb to ensure it finds them via the default file path.
