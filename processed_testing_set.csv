194kp3akhgqjeq,194kp3a,khgqjeq,LiteraryBoner,2024-01-12 03:09:41 UTC,,,I was in highschool when the original Mean Girls came out  Watched it spread like wildfire  always loved it because it s just one of those instantly classic comedies  Juggernaut performances from huge stars and future stars  so quotable  and it s very honest in the way that it talks to young people  It s just one of those cosmically great films  And I gotta say  watching a musical remake of a musical I m not familiar with twenty years later that is now aimed at a younger generation was extremely uncanny and I don t think I was able to get over it  Mean Girls is basically committed to memory  so to see it reference and parody itself and make changes was kind of distracting    Some of the songs were a lot of fun  we all know the studio made the odd choice to not name it or advertise it as a musical so it was good to see it s very purely a musical  Definitely enjoyed most the music and choreo  there were a couple decisions that were very strange but decisions nonetheless  It s kind of a bummer when your lead in a musical never gets the chance to belt and that s how I felt about Cady  Renee Rapp is great but McAdams  Regina George is one of the great comedic performances of all time and I felt like this movie really was not keeping up with the comedic chops of the original  I thought Cravahlo was really good and kinda the best dressed    I guess it s unfair to compare it to the original because they are just different things and in a way this is an adaptation of something totally different  but the characters here just didn t get me interested  The other two plastics played it so dumb that I started to miss Seyfried and Chabert s more down to Earth performances  They were dumb but more believably young whereas Rapp and Avantika look extremely tall and grown  This movie is strange in how it leans more in to not caring that these highschoolers look older  but it s also for a very young crowd with added lines about love languages and unresolved trauma as well as several TikTok montages  Just generally felt like the songs would add a lot of depth to stuff I didn t care about  like Cady s love for Math  and the parts of the plot and jokes I like were zoomed past almost like they felt like obligation    Really strong cast of teachers that were wildly under utilized  I wish this movie made me laugh a lot more  but one part that got me was Conor Ratliff  shame Dead Eyes is over because I bet this could have been a whole season  clapping for Kevin G s talent show act  Also the only scene that really got to me emotionally was the gymnasium confession  which until the song starts is really just a remake of the original scene  I wanted something new out of this and I didn t really get it  but maybe the music will grow on me  There s a couple I could see ending up on my showtunes playlist  some really strong voices in there  It s a 5 10 for me  didn t hate it didn t love it  mostly perplexed as to why they changed one of the most recognizable insults of all time  fugly slut  to cow while they said slut like 11 other times ,Official Discussion,Mean Girls,0.9035829305648804

1gvrno4ly5l5la,1gvrno4,ly5l5la,spiderlegged,2024-11-20 20:17:09 UTC,,,I agree with you  And a part of that is that Sweeney Todd is probably one of the best musicals ever written  It s also very  not all that musical like  The music is structured more like an opera  so the show itself doesn t feel as musical y  However  I like Sweeney because goddamnit it I m going to watch a movie based on a musical  I want the thing to be a movie and not a musical  One of the reasons Into the Woods was so bad is because they utilized none of the elements of a movie  The blocking was literally theater blocking  The set was pretty static  I think they literally used the choreo from the original production for  Agony   If I wanted to watch a recording of the stage show  I could  With the original cast  On the same streaming platform  Sweeney was VERY aware it was a movie and used that to its advantage  The  By the Sea  sequence is really the best example of what I want from a movie musical  It s looking like Wicked is going to fall more into the Sweeney camp  from the leaked  What is this Feeling  clip  So I m hopeful  It s like Hollywood both somehow resents musicals  but also refuses to let movie musicals have the space to be  well  movies too  ETA  about Sweeney  they also took the characters in a different direction than they had been portrayed before  especially HBC s Mrs  Lovett  who had up until that movie  been portrayed as a older  kooky lady  That made it feel even more original ,Discussion,Wicked,0.6138620376586914

194kp3akhmtsoe,194kp3a,khmtsoe,SharksFan4Lifee,2024-01-13 05:56:15 UTC,,,Saw the On Wednesdays We Wear Pink Advance Screening   Let s get this out of the way first  For a film that is incredibly and very deliberately diverse  a film that casts a Latina Gretchen  Indian female Karen  Janice is Hawaiian  Damian is Black  every ethnicity for all the cast members  so much LGBTQ representation  it is RIDICULOUS that the film would reinforce the Indian male nerd stereotype and cast an Indian as Kevin G  just as the original film  It was fine in the original film  but this film  goes out of its way  to be diverse and have representation  Did nobody involved in the production stop and think   hmmm MAYBE 2024 Kevin G shouldn t just be an Indian male nerd like he was in 2004   This crap bugs me  You want to be progressive  you want to be woke  but not when it comes to Indian males  Roger that and shame on all of you involved in this production   Otherwise  the film that is based on a musical  full disclosure  haven t seen it yet   which is based on a movie  which is inspired by a book  is OK  Really rides that OK line  Cast is fine  Jaquel Spivey as Damian is a standout  he has the funniest line in the movie  which is the opening joke of the film about Cloverfield  I didn t really dislike anyone except it s just a little too odd to have Tina Fey and Tim Meadows here  New cast should mean new cast  not new cast but Tina and Tim are here  I ll save my thoughts on another cast member for the end   Songs are not great except for  My name is Regina George   If most of the songs were bangers  that would have really salvaged this  Just having one that lives rent free in my head isn t enough   The film does something interesting in changing aspect ratios for musical numbers  The film is in what appears to be 1 85 1  but switches to 2 35 1 for certain numbers  Very cool  right  Sure   until some of the songs didn t have the aspect ratio change  Once you do the aspect ratio change for several songs  it sticks out when you don t do it for others  Like you are telling the audience that these other songs don t matter  Didn t care for that   Otherwise  the direction and cinematography are good   What salvages this movie for me is Angourie Rice  I love her in anything she s in  even her cheesy roles in the MCU Spider Man films  But especially ever since what I first her saw in  a very underrated Australian end of the world is coming movie   These Final Hours   Check that out  She s great and charming here   Ultimately  FYI  this movie was always planned to be direct to streaming on Paramount Plus  A change was made to give it a theatrical release  I suppose that makes financial sense given the diehard Mean Girls fans out there  but this still is just a  Direct to Streaming  quality movie  Maybe the musical is better  but I haven t seen it yet  so I cannot judge  I can only judge what is before me   Angourie Rice   the movie being OK gets it to 2 5 5 stars  It s not terrible  except for trying to be progressive but still reinforcing stereotypes about Indian males   but it s not great  I m not even sure it s good ,Official Discussion,Mean Girls,0.5733166337013245

194kp3akhmerge,194kp3a,khmerge,TheNewAnonima234,2024-01-13 03:46:32 UTC,,,I really enjoyed this movie     In fact  the only negative thing that I can say about this movie  which is really a complaint I had about both movies  is that  despite making Regina out to be more empathetic  there was never any accountability for Janis and Damien s characters    I mean  in both movies it felt like Cady had to bend over backwards to regain their  friendship   and  yet  I m not sure that  if I was in the same position as Cady s character was  that I d describe the relationship as friendship  I mean  from the jump  they took pity on Cady sure but then they essentially only used her as a tool to get back at Regina  And that is not friendship    Even in the OG Mean Girls  I do not actually recall Regina s character being out right mean to Cady at all  Blunt sometimes  harsh  critical  a jealous streak a mile wide but  no  not mean  I mean she certainly could ve been  but instead she invited her into the plastics and made her feel welcome  Even if what Gretchen told Cady was true  that she only gave her the shoes to make fun of her because she knew she would not be able to walk in them  which I have doubts on because I think it would be right up Gretchen s personality to feel like Cady s a threat to her position and friendships and to try to force her out of the group  she  Regina  never actually was seen saying that first hand    Thus  Cady s justified in her guilt and doubts over her actions against Regina  And would ve been just ified to stay friends with both groups of people  or neither  And it makes Janis look 10x worse in turn because she cares more about her revenge on Regina then any of Cady s opinions  or true well being  and becoming almost more dictating than Regina was ,Official Discussion,Mean Girls,0.3408857583999634

Anyways  here is the list and my rating of each movie  For ratings  I simply went with my enjoyment of the film overall and likeliness to rewatch  rather than quality of the film as a whole  For that I would rather rely on crowdsourced data anyways  I rated movies with the half star system  i e  1 10 without decimals  so to avoid everything being 6 8  I was quite harsh  I don t necessarily think

1aujffapost,1aujffa,,Complete_Road_2641,2024-02-19 09:34:56 UTC,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1aujffa/,8.0,In the past couple of years  there has been almost an unmitigated negativity surrounding the near term prospects of Warner Bros Pictures   largely stemming from a catastrophic mismanagement of their DC properties  criticism  deserved or otherwise  of CEO and commander in chief David Zaslav  and the debt fallout of one of the worst financial mergers of recent times   In my opinion  the recent handling and deal making of the studio gives reason for significant optimism regarding the outlook of its film division in the coming years  An extremely biased and speculation heavy breakdown follows below     Recent Film Production Deals    A number of promising production and distribution deals have been struct by WBD over the past year and recent months     Coogler Jordan Genre Picture    In recent days  Warners has won a competitive bid for a historical genre pic  rumor around town has it that the film is historically set in a 1930s era film  and is a genre pic involving vampires or other supernatural creatures with possible anime influences   This was undoubtedly seen by the studio to form a relationship with a director star team  in the hope of future films down the road involving the partnership   the fact that this films sounds like it has franchise potential likely is also a big draw for the studio  The Jordan Coogler partnership has been one of the high points of recent years  with films including Fruitville Station  Creed  and Black Panther forming a commercial and critical track record that is praise worthy and sets a high bar for any future partnerships  As an additional note  my feeling is that there is no way Warners would have bowed out of the running for the  28 Days Later  sequels bid against Sony  unless this deal was locked in   and signals that they have strong confidence in the film  The fact that the film is set to enter production in April means that this one may have a fairly quick turn around  with a possible 2025 release     Creature Features    Warners is obviously looking around to establish clear franchise or dependable box office hits  in line with the statements expressed multiple times by Zaslav  One interesting line of potential future avenues to mine  is recent announcements made alluding to bringing back the creature feature style films that was a backbone of WB Old Hollywood offerings in the 50s and 60s  Recent announcements include the soon to start filming Frankenstein s bride inspired flick  starring Christian Bale and Directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal  Additionally  pre production was announced on a reboot of the sci fi Them  with famed Hollywood composer Michael Giacchino tapped to make his big screen directorial debut  and Tim Burton being attached to direct a reboot of Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman with Gillian Flynn on scripting duties     Prestige Pics    There are a number of prestige pictures that have been locked in for production recently  Front of billing on this is Alto Knights  which in my opinion is the largest question mark of the four  Robert De Niro stars in a double billing as 50s mob bosses Vito Genovese and Frank Costello   the film gives off real The Irishman round 2 vibes  A recent surprise was the announcement that Paul Thomas Andersons next had landed at Warners and is currently filming  starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn  Considering the draw of DiCaprio  and track record of brilliance PTA brings  there is high hopes pinned on this one  Juror No 2 is the final film with Clint Eastwood in the directors chair   which presumably Warners will be pinning their advertising on  Considering the criticism Zaslav leveled at the green lighting of Eastwood s previous picture with Warner s  warranted criticism IMHO  considering the general audience and reception of Cry Macho   excepting of course the wisdom in delivering this criticism the way and on the platform that he did   it s likely there is considerably more commercial appeal seen in this one  Here s hoping  Additionally  Warners won a heated auction to the rights for Drowning  The Rescue of Flight 1421  With Paul Greengrass attached to direct this one  and with the amount of heat around Hollywood regarding the Auction for this  this is seen as a promising win for Warners   no doubt they are hoping for a success similar to what Sony found with Captain Phillips  Word is also incredibly strong on the Zach Creggers film Weapons  that Warners  through New Line  again won in a competitive bid with Universal  with a massive deal struck atypical for a director with only one film under his belt  It s a promising sign     The DCU    Obviously  this is the big one  After the disaster  especially in the last two or three years  of the previous DC big screen efforts  Warners needs a massive reset of strategy and leadership  Quality of the films produced  and way out of control budgets  plagued WB with a previous DC slate that has been massively unprofitable   especially when compared to the disproportionate success of the MCU  and the massive amounts of goodwill that was kicked off by the Nolan trilogy  and arguably kicked off the current era of a film landscape dominated by superheroes   The decision to elect James Gunn and Peter Safran to new heads of the rebranded DCU division seems extremely promising  Gunns  Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy closer was a bright spot amongst flagging MCU offerings in the previous year  and he has a proven track record of originality and directorial vision  Initial steps on the film side  such as pre production and casting starts on Superman  Lagacy  The Authority  Batman  The Brave and the Bold  Supergirl  Woman of Tomorrow and Swamp Thing point to a clear roadmap and creative vision  far removed from the scatter gun approach that previous regimes under the Snyder era of DC films seemed to take  It points to a promising sign for future DCU outings on the big screen   and Warners is clearly backing the efforts by Gunn and Safran  as they need this reboot of their most valuable piece of IP to succeed in a big way     Animation Bets    Warner Bros has struggled massively to firmly establish a foothold in the animation division of Hollywood  Intermittent successes  including Iron Giant  Space Jam  Corpse Bride and The Lego Movie  are interspersed with failed efforts and box office disappointments  A couple of interesting developments could spell good things for Warners Animation efforts  however  Shortly after Bill Damaschke was elected as the new head of Warners re branded animation division  Warners inked a first look deal with Locksmith Animation last year  Locksmith is relatively new company  with only one film under its belt   it s first film Ron is Wrong was a surprisingly successful film for a first effort of a fledgling studio  and Warners has signed on to co produce two upcoming productions  Bad Fairies  and The Lunar Chronicles   an adaption of Marissa Meyers bestselling Grimms fairy tales based sci fi novels   Considering comments made by Zaslav that Warners Animation efforts was second only to its DC division  and the long in development films including Toto  Dr Seuss films such as The Cat in the Hat and Oh the Places You ll Go  and legacy WB animation properties such as a Flintstones prequel as well as a number of loony tunes  Hannah Barbera and DC properties  a renewed focus in building out its animation division could yield great returns for Warners Studio efforts as a whole     Renewed Focus on Franchises    One of the foundational messages of the Zaslav era has been a renewed focus on franchises  The Zaslav administration has been extremely busy deal making  with prospective revamps and reboots of what they see as the crown jewels of Warner s existing IP This is all in an attempt to capitalize and grow on successful films that saw them rule the box office landscape in the early and late 2000s   Chief among these is the LOTR deal  which saw Warners broker a deal with the Tolkien estate to produce multiple new films based on the LOTR books  As one of the most beloved trilogies of all time  The Lord of the Rings represents a massive opportunity for Warners if done well   Harry Potter is also seeing renewed focus   with a TV remake of the books in production at HBO  However  Zaslav has noted that they are exploring further opportunities to capitalize and explore Rowling s world  With the relative failure of the Fantastic Beasts franchise  this IP still represents a massive opportunity for the studio on the big screen  With the renewed focus on the franchise  no doubt options are being explored to further capitalize on this IP and develop feature films   Announcements have also been made on legacy sequel bets  to make the most of the IP Warners has sitting unused  Most notably  I am Legend 2  Oceans 11 Prequel  with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling   a Constantine Sequel  The Accountant Sequel  Sherlock  and the currently filming Beetlejuice Beetlejuice have all received production or press updates in recent months  With a aim to re capitalise on existing IP  movement on one or many of the above is incredibly likely in the next few years   Additional entries in the currently successful franchises of the wider Conjuring verse  as well as the Monster verse  Godzilla and Kong related entries  are likely to continue and seem set for semi regular large screen entries for the next several years to come     First Look Deals    Several deals have been struck recently  that bodes well for Warners re establishing itself as a creator s studio  The recent partnership deal between Tom Cruise and Warners received a massive amount of press  However  this will likely be years away from yielding any fruit   as Mission Impossible  and the Liman space film  and possibly a further Top Gun sequel  will likely keep him busy in the near future  However  it s nevertheless a good get for the studio  First look deals have also been recently been struck with Margot Robbie  ohn M  Chu  M  Night Shyamalan  Baz Luhrman  John M Chu  Shyamalan  Baz Luhrman  Matt Reeves  Andy Muschietti  Todd Phillips and Bradley Cooper   cementing the idea that Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy are hard at work  re establishing ties with the film making community  and increasing the likelihood of exciting future projects making a home at the studio in the next several years     Debt Trap Leadership    A tremendous amount of criticism has been levelled at Zaslav  and by proxy Warner Bros  due to the treatment of a number of films shelved due to tax reasons  Principal among these include Scoob 2  Batgirl  and the recent Coyote vs  Acme  Accusation and rather insane rants have been directed at Zaslav in a torrent of very stern words over the internet over the previous year  However  this vastly mis understands the reason Zaslav was elected to the top position   Warners  at the time of Zaslav gaining the top position  was beset with a mountain of insane levels of debt  that still threaten the overall company with bankruptcy   the debt largely stemming from the catastrophic AT T acquisition and Discovery merger  Previous studio heads  when the economy was cooking and money flowing  had made some nonsensical studio decisions  These included greenlighting enormously budgeted films with very little sense in how these would make back their budgets   namely DC movies with enormous budgets and very low likelihood of success  especially in direct competition with a well oiled MCU machine   This was also combined with a mistreatment of potential reboot and franchise opportunities  The Matrix  Fantastic Beasts and Space Jam come to mind   the financial and reputational disaster of direct release films to MAX during the Covid epidemic  and lack of focus on the IP Warners did own  It was a train wreck   the fact that Godzilla vs Kong  A Conjuring Movie  Dune  Barbie and Wonka were the only significant successes  excluding some minor successes in between  in the four year stretch from 2020 to 2023 signals just how dire the previous leadership was  given the production and financial decisions   Looking at the films realistically  the first Scoob was critically a dud  and commercially did not make a dent  granted this was during Covid   From a financial point of view  this sequel film had little to none chance of success  especially considering the advertising and screening costs to get the film in theatres   Zaslav was undoubtably correct that his was more valuable as a write off than a release  Batgirl  again from the looks of it  was in dire straits  Pre screening reviews and studio notes indicated this was not a top tier DC film  a fairly low bar given their near term previous output   and had a unfeasibly high budget for any kind of direct to MAX release   again  this was a film riddled with the financial malpractice decision making of the previous leadership  The C vs A film was a little different granted   the early word and reviews were great  scoring extremely high reviews  However  given the animation style and general budget  this was not going to be a film that represented any kind of real profit for the film  Chief in point   Warners set the film for sale and has only just been finally put down to rest in the last few days  Warners would likely have accepted any offer from another studio  that would have granted them more cash than the tax write off from shelving the pic altogether  The fact that no other studio was willing to pony up the capital for this speaks volumes   it s a shame for the creatives and workers on the film  and it may have been a good film  but Zaslav is ultimately charged with righting a financially sinking ship  Nothing in the above suggests he made the wrong decision   As a side note slightly separate to the film side of the Warners business   Another controversial decision has included the licencing out the valuable film and TV properties to other streaming services  rather than a straight exclusive to MAX approach  However  Warners had the only successful streaming service  except for Netflix I believe  last quarter  and the revenues gained from licencing film and TV properties  for example  the friends TV show of the DCU films  will massively help cash flow and debt paydown  This seems like a smart move from Zaslav  especially considering the mountains of cash that Paramount  Disney etc  have thrown at streaming platforms with no as yet profit to show for it     2024    There is a fantastic breakdown of the 2024 WB films here by  valkyria  knight881  https

share utm medium web3x utm name web3xcss utm term 1 utm content share button   However  as general comment  I see this as one of the strongest film slates  and definitely the most interesting  of the major studios for the year   I ll breakdown what I see as the largest films of each of the major studios below   note that personal discretion and interest has very much played a part in what films have gotten a mention below  and I ve generally covered films that have been produced by the respective studios and excluded distribution only films  Granted  there are some films likely undated and may be added to the 2024 slate later down the track  But by all means  feel free to nitpick  and include films I ve missed out in the comments of this post     Competitor Studios   Disney    The major competitor is obviously Disney  however the behemoth that is the MCU is absent except for Deadpool 3  which is in my opinion  controversially  somewhat over hyped  As I see it  the R rating and fatigue regarding the MCU studio offerings may play a limiting factor to the films overall Box Office   The big plays are largely isolated to Animated  or Animation to Live Action films  Inside Out 2 and Moana 2 are locks for successful BO takes  Note that Moana was the most streamed film over the previous year  which bodes very well for its success   with Mufasa  The Lion King being a little more uncertain in terms of potential success  Considering the massive debut of the original Lion King Live Action Remake however  I can t see how this one doesn t result in a significant success for the studio  Other studio bets include the 20th Century Studios releases of Alien  Romulus and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes   however the first is an essential reboot after several less than impressive offerings in the franchise  and the last is a reboot after the conclusion of the previous trilogy  Anything is possible if these turn out to be incredibly well made films here  however these are franchise beginning films rather than concluding set pieces  which may result in slightly dampened Box Office earnings compared to the blockbuster 2019 and prior years for the studio     Competitor Studios   Paramount    The only real lock for Paramount this year in my opinion  is likely to be A Quiet Place   Day One  Previous entries in the franchise were staggeringly well made  did incredibly well commercially and critically   and is genuinely one of the most exciting new franchises out of Hollywood in the last half decade  However  they do have several interesting bets on the docket for the year  IF appears very much targeted towards a young children family audience and so may play well to an under served demographic   but this may also be to its detriment  by limiting target audience overall for the film  Krasinski really scored for Paramount with A Quiet Place previously  so he may work some magic  and catch lightening in a bottle for a second time  However  response to initial trailers is fairly muted  granted it is very early to make a call here   Beverly Hills  and Animated Transformers Prequel and Sonic are likely to be successful   however the first is a legacy sequel with target appeal very much limited to an older nostalgia demographic  Transformers has had a history of declining BO over the previous decade  and Sonic has been mildly successful  with what I see as limited upside potential on previous films  Gladiator 2 is the real wildcard for the year   a massive nostalgia play on a film that absolutely broke the box office doors a couple of decades ago  It will very much depend on execution  and trying to light up interest among a younger audience for the sword and sandal epics that were once so successful in a Hollywood era  previous to the current superhero dominant fare  Note that this is a co production with Universal  which I have not included in the studio run down below     Competitor Studios   Universal    Universal has a number of interesting films for the year  and rivals Warners in terms of breadth in their offerings  Their animation offerings are particularly promising  Kung Fu Panda 4 and Despicable Me 4 will likely do gangbusters for obvious reasons that aren t worth justifying  and The Wild Robot is the first serious new franchise play in a while for Dreamworks  The studio seems high on prospects for this one  The fact that Chris Sanders has been tapped to direct this picture is an obvious point of confidence for the film  considering his previous track record  The Monkey Man  by all accounts rescued by Jordan Peele for a theatrical release  will likely be successful   this years The Beekeeper has shown there is legs in these John Wick style flicks  as long as they are competently made and with a budget kept under control  The Fall Guy  Twisters and Wicked  Part One are the big budget gambles for the year  Early notes on The Fall Guy seem extremely positive  and Gosling has hardly put a foot wrong in recent years   all signs point to an outsized success for the film  Twisters may be a bit more of a roll of the dice   However a bankful of cash has been thrown at the film  and a who s who of young up and coming stars  Daisy Edgar Jones  Glen Powell and Anthony Ramos  has been assembled  with an acclaimed indie director on the rise  Lee Isaac Chung  of Minari fame  to lead the film   Note   Warners is a co producer of this film  which I ve excluded from the studio rundown further down this post   Wicked also seems like a lock for success as one of the most beloved musicals of recent years and seems uniquely suited for a big screen adaption  The Blumhouse produced Wolfman could go either way   but the studio is very good at delivering on tightly budgeted horror films  Of perhaps more limited box office appeal are The Bikeriders and Nosferatu   but word from festival screenings of The Bikeriders is phenomenal  and while Robert Eggers produces highly divisive films  he certainly creates films that are singular and unique  I m rooting for both  if only on the chance that more of these non franchise studio bets get made in future     Competitor Studios   Sony    Sony continues with its efforts to spin off a Spiderman derived universe of its own superhero films  It may be my own personal bias speaking  but I have very little hope that these will see any significant box office success  I m expecting that Madame Web and Kraven the Hunter both dive and bomb  with Venom 3 likely to make a modest profit when all the chips have fallen   but hey  here s hoping I m wrong  Sony also has a couple of potential franchise starters slated for the year   including an animated reboot of Garfield  a fourth Bad Boys film  and a Karate Kid film  Garfield could over perform  but any out sized expectations by way of last years The Super Mario Bros Movie is far and away overshooting the profit potential of this flick in my opinion  and is likely to make a much more modest profit overall  Bad boys will likely still be overshadowed by Will Smiths  precipitous decline in cultural cache and popularity  as he is nowhere near the draw that he previously would have been even a decade ago  for a return to a beloved franchise  The karate kid movie might surprise   the recent TV adaption has generated a renewed interest and critical acclaim in the franchise  However it remains to be seen if this can be translated onto the big screen  and may not lend itself well to the current effects heavy era of action films that have performed well in the current box office environment  Ghostbusters the frozen empire will likely do well  Its one of the franchises Sony is clearly carefully producing  and the previous entry was well executed and budgeted  if not exactly awe inspiring      Warner Bros    I see Warners as having the most impressive and diverse slate for the year  especially given the comparative emptiness in the box office lineup when looking at previous years  Godzilla x Kong is likely to continue being a strong franchise performer  especially considering the surprise outsized success of Godzilla Minus One recently  indicating stong interest from audiences to witness super powered megafauna wreak general havoc on the big screen  Dune  Part Two in my opinion is likely to surprise on the upside   its previous entry was considered a rare win during the Covid era box office  and combined with the Chalamet Zendaya draw  critical reception of the previous film  and relatively empty release window that it debuts into  the potential on this one is extremely promising  Furiosa is a wild card  The Miller Mad Max pics are extremely expensive  but essentially fills a niche of its own   being a heavily stylised  frenetic box office action picture  It will be one to watch  to see if it can justify the budget allotted  and make a healthy profit  The Shyamalan one two of The Watchers and Trap  the first by Shayamalan the younger  the second by Shyamalan the older  will likely continue the low budget horror that Warners has seen success with in the past  and further cement the relationship with the family that Warners clearly wants to continue  Joker  Folie a Deux follows up one of the most profitable big budget pictures of the last decade  with a surprise swing into musical territory  Phillips has shown himself as a auteur who can deliver in a big way in the box office   I don t see the outsized success of Joker repeating it s insane debut run  but this is likely to do very good numbers  Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is the nostalgia play for the year  and a bit of a question mark  Considering WB recently tapped Burton for a remake of Attack of the 50ft Women  they are likely high on this film  And there is a significant amount of good will on the still popular original film 36 years on from its original debut date  I m pegging this to surprise on the upside   Burton is due a win  after the last few relative disappointments  LOTR   The War of the Rohirrim is a hard one to parse  Initially pegged as an IP placeholder  it s a bit of a trial for Hollywood into anime inspired animation territory  Warners has struggled to establish an animation division in recent years  after the initial Lego movie success petered out   but Zaslav has indicated a real desire to mine LOTR as one of the most significant pieces of IP WB owns  and could yield a real avenue for future sequels and spin offs  it this one delivers  Warners has one other insane bet with Kevin Costners Horizon duo of films out in 2024  The unique release strategy  releasing the films two months apart  and subject matter  inter generational westerns haven t been the go to for new hollywood box office properties since the 70s  makes this a dubious bet  However WB have hedged the financials well on this movie  Costner and outside funding has contributed to the lions share of the production budget   and the yellowstone driven revival of western properties in general might drive a significant audience to Costners  big gamble  if given the chance  This is definitely a wait and see  Mickey 17 is another big franchise bet for the studio  Big screen hard sci fi has been a tricky ask for hollywood profit wise  however Warners did magic with the Dune film  and are clearly hoping for a repeat  Bong Joon Ho directs this one  and Robert Pattinson starts  so it has no shortage of talent attached  I see this as being a difficult sell  but one that could be a revelation if all goes well     Final Thoughts    There are more thoughts on potential franchises  opportunities and leverage points for Warners film division   particularly exploiting IP it owns through Warner Brothers TV series  which is a massive opportunity waiting to be exploited  There are parts of the film division I ve largely left unmentioned   such as the  elseworld  section of the DC universe forming  currently consisting of the Joker and Pattinson Batman franchises  But that might all have to wait for a future post  All in ll  I m incredibly excited at the future prospects of Warner Brothers  after a fairly dire previous few years  and what I consider to be dubious management at a studio level  If you made it this far   cheers  Looking forwards to hearing your thoughts in the comments ,Discussion,Kung Fu Panda 4,0.7213369011878967

16my5yypost,16my5yy,,GroveManEndlesIncite,2023-09-19 18:14:37 UTC,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16my5yy/,0.0, The stop motion surreal horror movie Mad God has been described in many reviews as one of the most bizarre and inscrutable movies in recent memory  With no dialogue Mad God s narrative is communicated entirely through visuals and action  Nonetheless I believe a clear plot line can be surmised from these elements  along with some interpretation of their symbolism through historical and cultural context  I ll go through the scenes presented in a mostly linear fashion  as much as I can while still interpreting the plot      We begin with a scene of a mighty tower covered in torches and surrounded by a crowd while triumphant music plays  A humanoid figure gesticulates atop the towers spiraling pinnacle  This figure gets struck and destroyed by lightning and the dark storm clouds from whence it came slowly envelop the entire scene      Due to the stone architecture and lack of electric lights I believe this scene takes place in the world s ancient past  The figure atop the tower is a figure of authority to the crowds below  I suspect a prophet or religious leader  This figure is commiting a blasphemy by making himself equal to God  standing high amidst the heavens to be revered by the people  I believe this blasphemy is the original sin that brings down the wrath of the titular Mad God      Next we see a dark scroll with twisted text quoting a passage from the book of Leviticus of the Christian Bible which is a curse upon the subjects swearing to make their lands so desolate even their enemies will weep when they conquer them  This basically confirms that the Mad God has cursed the world with unsurpassable suffering      Now the narrative proper begins  A human figure enters a mechanical tube similar in design to a deep sea diving Bathysphere  The figure s outfit is reminiscent of a soldier  particularly a soldier from the trenches of World War I  World War I was infamous for the introduction of many horrific methods of industrialized killing  such as mustard gas  heavy explosive artillery  machine guns  and heavily armored combat vehicles  Trench warfare became infamous for being a nightmarish meat grinder in which many soldiers literally dug their own graves  dieing in droves within their trenches from disease and exposure if enemy weapons didn t get them first      That this figure emulates the uniform of such soldiers is important symbolism  It hints that he has a violent purpose or mission  that this world is at war  and that he is ultimately expendable with little value given to his life beyond his role in the mission      The soldier descends past a mighty fortress or prison type building which is bristling with cannons  watch towers  and search lights  He seems to be detected and these cannons light up the sky with explosives  The soldier reacts to this calmly  as though he was expecting it  This demonstrates that there is an opposing force entrenched to stop this soldier and that he is cognizant of it  basically confirming that war is being waged here      After passing by this enemy fortification the soldier descends through several distinct  layers  that at first glance seem somewhat random  However they all have a theme of death or extinction  The most obvious reference to extinction are dinosaur bones but there s also a layer full of statues and idols which represent extinct religions or societies  Due to distinct layers as the soldier descends and the presence of dinosaur bones I believe this scene represents not just the soldier descending physically but metaphorically going back chronologically to periods that predate the surface  In the study of fossils the layer of earth in which the fossil is found is often indicative of its age  deeper fossils are typically older  So I believe the final strata upon which the soldier lands is older than the rest  perhaps the oldest  society  in the world      The scene that the soldier finds here is initially one of dust and destruction  He proceeds uninterruptedly  stopping only to consult a map  This is subtle but it s the first display of the soldiers character  he is only concerned about his own destination and accomplishing his mission  We see this character displayed again when he squashes a couple insect sized men under his boot as he continues forward without so much as pausing      These tiny men are perhaps the first  weird and random  scene but besides demonstrating the soldiers callousness it also has important symbolism  The two tiny men are dressed up like garden gnomes and seem to be arguing over the possession of a Santa Claus outfit  My interpretation of this requires skipping ahead slightly  A couple scenes later we see a monkey like creature strapped to a medical bed beg the soldier to help him escape  We see a doll with the same eyes as the monkey after the soldier refuses to help  Something is turning these creatures into dolls  I suspect the same force created these miniature men and outfitted them like garden gnomes  This creates a recurring theme  the commidification of life  Since the two men have bushy white beards like most depictions of Santa Claus and one of them holds a Santa outfit I suspect their argument is over who will play the role of Santa Claus for his  commodity   Garden Gnomes and Santa figures are the type of kitchsey decorations meant to be made and sold cheap to a mass market  Both men can t be Gnomes because then they re competing with each other in this  market   This feeds into a constant theme throughout Mad God  the creation and destruction of life for the purposes of industry and consumption      I think the soldier treading on the gnomes while they argue is another bit of clever symbolism  This world is one of constant conflict  the only differences are in the scales of the conflicts  The tiny conflict of the arguing gnomes is overridden by the larger conflict of the soldier s war  It can also symbolize the thoughtless civilian killings that happen as collateral damage in war  with the development of long range weaponry and remotely detonated explosives soldiers may kill non combatants without even realizing it  just as there s no indication the soldier here even notices the gnomes before he crushes them      As the soldier continues following the map he sees a figure who appears to be human although his legs are missing  mutated  or destroyed and his face is covered in mummy like wrappings  This  man  reels in the cord of a light that a rat like creature is gnawing on  implying this light is a trap he set to catch the critter presumably to eat  But perhaps the legless man has also been led into a trap as from a house on a hill overlooking the scene we see a disgusting creature emerge  with a slug like body but also human like limbs  But first we see brief scenes within the windows of the house  We see the silhouettes of a man madly playing a piano in one and another man repeatedly stabbing a woman in the other  I think this is a statement on the arbitrary social divisions in our society  The legless man lives in a pipe eating rats while people far more crazed and violent live in relative comfort  The disgusting slug like creature captures the legless man and butchers him with a meat cleaver while the soldier hides      This is the first time we see the soldier take obvious action for self preservation  while he may be fearless he still clearly understands this world is dangerous and rife with hazards that will interfere with his mission  The slug like creature seems intent on eating the legless man or using it to feed the people in the house from it came from  and may very well wish to do the same to the soldier if he s spotted  Despite the slug like creatures disgusting overall appearance it also has a clear pair of female human breasts  I think this detail was included for more than just shock value  The creature is female and has the stereotypically female role of being a housekeeper for the house on the hill  She intends to prepare and serve the legless man to the other people in the house  This represents how the lower classes are used up by the upper classes      The soldier continues on his way and encounters the captive monkey I mentioned earlier  This scene is important because the soldier is shown to be aware of the monkeys pleading and literally shut the door in his face regardless  The soldier isn t just careless  he is deliberately unconcerned for the individuals suffering in this hellish underworld      Now the soldier reaches what I believe is the target of his mission  the beginning of a self perpetuating factory that s fueled and maintained by endless suffering  The first stage of this bizarrely cruel apparatus is a row of electric chairs that constantly shock and torture the giant men confined in them  The soldier is just as small to these giants as the gnomes he stepped on were to him  again illustrating the larger scale of conflict the soldier has just entered  Beneath the electric chairs is excreted some thick yellowish good which may be the giants melted flesh  blood  shit  or other bodily fluid  I don t think it particularly matters what this good is  just that it s produces by the giants suffering  The goo is then literally swallowed by a tall bloody biomechanical apparatus which ultimately mass produces dark gray humanoid creatures which immediately march out to labor in the next part of the apparatus  a hot  deadly  industrial forge that produces large black rectangular  monoliths  for lack of a better word  So the giants are tortured for the fuel which creates disposable workers for the monolith factory  I believe this is a statement that whatever the originators  the giants here  intended when they founded a system or society it will always be twisted and tortured to serve the purposes of industry with subsequent generations  conflict and suffering are the inescapable absolutes of this world  The biomechanical machinery represents how both the flesh  human workers  and the machinery  capital and industry  are designed and directed towards mass production      As the soldier makes his way through the monolith factory he witnesses constant accidents which kill the workers produced by and for the factory  Nonetheless the workers are egged on by PA systems and screens which display grotesque eyeballs and talking mouths  The only  words  emitted by these devices  however  are gibberish baby babble  This represents how the doctrines  words  and even bodies of leaders and tyrants are ultimately irrelevant  the system will be turned to extractive and destructive industry regardless of who leads it or what these leaders say  All that really matters is that the workers believe their leaders are spying on them and ordering them around  hence the eyes and mouths on the screens      If the workers step out of line they are whipped by giant creatures similar in body shape to the slug like creature earlier but even more grotesque  Despite their cruelty to the workers these creatures are also cared for by the workers who clean their disgusting bodies  the creatures appear to be constantly defecating on themselves and everything around them  I believe these creatures represent the middle management and police class the ruling class uses to discipline and control the ruling class  As in real life these creatures consume while creating nothing of value and are propped up and looked after by the same workers they oppress  showing how the workers become complicit in their own oppression      Finally the soldier reaches the trapdoor that leads further down to his destination  The map he s been reading has crumpled away to nothing and there s no where else for him to descend to  But before he does one of the workers notices him and runs over  The soldiers looks askew at the creature  apparently surprised it showed any intelligence or free will by coming over to meet him  Like the monkey beforehand the worker seems like it wants the soldier to help him escape and once again the soldier literally shuts the door on him  Then one of the grostesque creatures notice the worker stepped out of line and roars with rage before stomping the worker to death      Now the soldier has reached his goal and we see that many of his comrades have come before him as the barren darkness is covered with mountains of suitcases identical to the one the soldier carries  We then see the contents of this case as the soldier opens and deploys it at the base of a mountain of others  it contains a dynamite bomb which he sets the timer on  The obvious interpretation is that many have come before him and failed to detonate their bomb  I think another possibility is that perhaps all the other soldiers were contributing their bombs for one massive detonation  After all the individual case the soldier carries is far too small to destroy much considering the explosives are labelled as mere dynamite  However if all the countless cases were to detonate simultaneously they d surely destroy the hellish factory the soldier has just passed through  which the later acts lead me to believe is the soldier s mission  In war it s rare for any individual soldier to be responsible for a great act of destruction but every individual soldiers effort combined can cause mass destruction      Immediately after the soldier sets the bomb he is captured by a hideous mechanical giant spider  The symbolism of the spider is obvious  they catch their prey in a trap before consuming them  Clearly a trap has been prepared  perhaps every previous soldier has met this exact same fate      The soldier is taken to a theater where he appears in silohette on the screen  He s strapped down to a medical bed and stripped naked by three other figures in silohette  the central figure is human but the other two are more deformed  While the soldier is stripped the audience laughs  I m reminded of a scene in the classic dystopian novel 1984  The 5 minute hate  where the masses of the dystopia join together to rage against the States designated enemy while watching video of them on a giant screen  This could also reflect how so much mean spirited comedy centers on the humiliation of  the other side   In any case it s clear the soldiers defeat and humiliation is being offered up as an entertainment product to the audience  Why are two of the figures stripping the soldier monstrous  Perhaps to show the audience will cheer for monsters so long as they re being used against an enemy      Next we get to one of the movies most disgustingly violent scenes  The view scrolls down past dozens of rooms containing vivisected human forms on medical beds  presumably the soldiers predecessors  Finally the view stops on the room containing the soldier  naked except for bandages covering his body and face and the medical apparatus connected to him  Two live action actors in medical scrubs  one male one female  The man clumsily reaches for a scalpel after injecting the soldier with an unknown liquid  Then he opens up his abdomen with a long decision right down the center  This  surgery  is incredibly bloody and the surgeon shows no care whatsoever for care or precision  He reaches inside the opening he made in the soldiers torso and literally rips out his innards  Bizarrely these contain blood soaked coins  jewelry  and books  I believe this represents in a literal way what metaphorically goes into creating a soldier  Wealth is used up to equipt him  knowledge is turned towards indoctrinating and training him  all aspects of culture are turned to the war effort in a full scale war  Ultimately all this cultural value is repurposed towards creating men who will kill and die effectively and without question      Beneath all this is a wriggling larva like creature that cries like a baby  This perhaps represents the original foundation for every soldier  his life  humanity  or soul  This is the only thing the surgeon shows any interest in  all else is discarded carelessly  The larva is swaddled like a baby and removed by the  nurse   Then the  doctor  drills a hole in the soldiers forehead and inserts a tube which is connected to a television  Perhaps this represents him extracting a soldiers knowledge in a literal way  rather then via interrogation techniques that are more typically used on captured soldiers      We witness the soldiers origins  An elderly bespectacled white man with extremely long fingernails goes through his daily routines in a desolate but relatively bright urban landscape  Unlike all the other creatures we ve seen thus far this man seems confident and calm  he clearly doesn t feel he s in any danger or at the behest of any other  His nails are so long he handles things in a somewhat slower or awkward way  this is a hint that he has no practical or social reasons to maintain trimmed nails  He lightheartedly picks out an outfit  after considering several options she dons the zucchetto skull cap and red vestements of a Catholic clergyman  As he examines many other outfits it seems he has no particular attachement to Catholicism  As we ll see shortly he s the one responsible for deploying the soldiers to the underworld so I believe his casual choice of religious garb shows how all religions and creeds are ultimately turned towards the purpose of mobilizing fighters      The old man passes a table and looks around it as though it s missing something he expected to be there  He looks under the table and sees 3 stop motion creatures that look kind of like typical fairly tale wicked witches  They are sewing together a large map  I believe these are supposed to be the Fates  From Wikipedia   The Fates are a common motif in European polytheism  most frequently represented as a trio of goddesses  The Fates shape the destiny of each human  often expressed in textile metaphors such as spinning fibers into yarn  or weaving threads on a loom  The trio are generally conceived of as sisters and are often given the names Clotho  Lachesis  and Atropos  which are the names of the Moirai  the version of the Fates who appear in Greek mythology       The old man takes the map after they ve finished piecing it together  This is given to the next soldier and it shows his missions destination and the route he should take to get there  The old man taking the map from the Fates demonstrates that while he sends out the soldiers  their destination and possibly entire mission is out of his control  This shows that even the leaders of armies do not have total control over the progress of war  that is up to the capricious whims of Fate and circumstances      The old man enters a large open hall where rank about rank of soldiers outfitted like the first stand  arranged in military order  He hands the map to one of the soldiers and we see that they are massive compared to the old man  at least 7 feet tall if the old man is of average height  I think this demonstrates that the soldiers are far removed from  normal  humans  that they have been created for war in both body and mind  The soldier takes the map and enters the same metal tube we saw at the start      He descends but lands in a different area than the first soldier we see  While this place is devastated like the other there s more obvious signs of human habitation  Many decrepit vehicles are strewn across the environment and eventually the soldier finds a motorbike that works  He rides into a ruined city when the bike breaks down  He takes out his binoculars and surveys the cities skyline of crumbling skyscrapers  He sees a human figure gazing back at him from a lit window in one of the towers  When the figure notices he s been spotted he quickly turns off the light and hides      The soldier finds a jeep which seems to be a military vehicle judging by the equipment it carries  including a search light  The soldier hotwires the jeep the radio turns on  He punches it until it shuts off  This demonstrates that the soldiers have some technical knowledge which indicates intelligence beyond being mindless golems  The radio playing might indicate there s still some sort of broadcasts from the inhabitants of these ruins which  along with the figure in the tower  indicates that while this place is ruined it hasn t been completely exterminated      As the soldier continues through this ruined city in the jeep he commandeered  A massive red creature descends from above  it looks like the textbook depiction of a human retrovirus and it zaps several human figures beneath it destroying them  This may be a metaphor for biological warfare or viral terrorism such as the anthrax virus mail attacks alleged to have occured in the US after the September

1c30bijkzeybw2,1c30bij,kzeybw2,apparent-evaluation,2024-04-13 18:03:16 UTC,,,I really liked it for what it was  But don t compare it to  RH POT  which was just terrible  It was one of the first movies I walked out of  TTM was incredibly enjoyable though      Robin Hood  Prince of Thieves  is a murky  unfocused  violent and depressing version of the classic story  with little of the lightheartedness and romance we expect from Robin Hood      Among the movie s many problems  Kevin Costner plays a tortured  thoughtful Robin Hood  totally lacking in the joy of living that we associate with the character  The romance between Robin and Maid Marian  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio  seems inspired more by necessity than by desire  as if both of them had read the book and knew they were required to fall in love  The most colorful character is the villain  the Sheriff of Nottingham  Alan Rickman   but both the character and the performance are inappropriate for this film     And the amount of gore is appalling in a film that will presumably be aimed at a family market     To begin with the gore  The movie begins with a hand being chopped off  and continues with various amputations  gorings  stabbings  burnings  floggings  hangings  a small boy is one of the intended hanging victims   explosions  and falls from great heights  before reaching a climax of sorts as the Sheriff of Nottingham attempts to rape Maid Marian  and has just succeeded in spreading her legs  a graphic  floor level shot here  before Robin Hood comes swinging in through the window to save her     Costner plays Robin Hood as if he were Alan Alda    Alan Rickman  in complete contrast  plays the Sheriff as if he were David Letterman  He s a wicked  droll  sly  witty master of the put down and one liners  who rolls his eyes in exasperation when Robin comes bursting in to interrupt the rape  Rickman s performance has nothing to do with anything else in the movie  and indeed seems to proceed from a uniquely personal set of assumptions about what century  universe  etc   the story is set in  but at least when Rickman appears on the screen we perk up  because we know we ll be entertained  at whatever cost to the story     The only major player who finds the right tone and voice for all of his scenes is Morgan Freeman  as the Moor  who finds humor when it is needed  courage when it is required  and somehow even survives being given a running joke that has to be carefully nurtured from one end of the movie to the other  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio does what she can with Marian  but must have been confused when the screenplay gave her a thoughtful  independent woman in the earlier scenes  and then turned her into a cliched damsel in distress at the end    The costumes look as if they have things growing in them    The treehouses in Sherwood Forest permit Robin and his men to engage in a key battle scene that looks like a cross between  Tarzan  and the savage tribesmen at the end of  Apocalypse Now    This battle deserves greater analysis  In it  hired Celtic mercenaries attack Robin s band and are all but destroyed  after which they only then use their fire catapults  and all but destroy Robin s side  after which  for the later assault on the castle  Robin hardly seems to have lost a man   The music is your standard rum dummy dum false epic dirge kind of stuff  The editing is desperate  The most depressing thing about the movie is that children will attend it expecting to have a good time ,Discussion,Wicked,0.3344931900501251

1gcevi5lttlbkw,1gcevi5,lttlbkw,mdmnl,2024-10-26 08:33:06 UTC,,, Why do I keep seeing commentary that Wicked will falter   I imagine you keep seeing it because you have interacted with it on social media and social media seeks to give you more of what it thinks you like   Or confirmation bias  you re remembering more of the criticism than the speculation excitement   I don t remember much on Reddit apart from the bland  first official poster  and  trailer  2  posts which  frankly  is more worrying   there s no such thing as bad ink after all    Huge Musical IPs do extremly well at box office with Cats being the only notable exception   I don t think so   I m not an expert but my layman s take on IP musicals is recently they ve tanked more than not   Edit  forgot West Side Story Budget  100 000 000  estimated  Gross worldwide  76 016 171  Dear Evan Hansen Budget  28 000 000  estimated  Gross worldwide  19 133 454  In The Heights Budget  55 000 000  estimated  Gross worldwide  45 175 167  Cats Budget  95 000 000  estimated  Gross worldwide  75 558 925  The Greatest Showman  does it count  Was it an original musical movie   Budget  84 000 000  estimated  Gross worldwide  469 064 959  Les Mis  201  Budget  61 000 000  estimated  Gross worldwide  442 757 529  Mamma Mia  Budget  52 000 000  estimated  Gross worldwide  611 452 132  Sweeney Todd Budget  50 000 000  estimated  Gross worldwide  153 384 272  In fact  mathematically  they should have cast Hugh Jackman   Like Moneyball for musicals    There is a shit ton of buzz on Tiktok  Not a useful metric  though I am a  male Redditor    shock horror     Cats had nowhere near the current presales and hype for Wicked   Cats had Taylor Swift and about 20  of SAG AFTRA and Equity  but it still shit the bed   Until recently I think many people didn t know who Cynthia Erivo was  I thought she was very good in Widows and El Royale  but I don t think she s a guaranteed nine figures at the box office on her own    If Wicked has a  145M budget it will need to land hard to succeed in Hollywood accounting terms   I don t have a dog in the fight   haven t seen Wicked  my wife despised it  but I don t personally benefit from movies bombing   I imagine having Ariana Grande in attracts a demographic who will try to drag it down by any means   I enjoy a good musical   but nothing about the trailer piqued my interest ,Discussion,Wicked,0.5283494591712952

194kp4vkhh3bhb,194kp4v,khh3bhb,TheBlackSwarm,2024-01-12 04:44:03 UTC,,,I wasn t going into this movie with any expectations I remember watching the trailer a few months back and laughing at how absurd this looked  January release  Kurt Wimmer writing  Point Break reboot and Expendables 4   David Ayer directing who hasn t put out a solid movie since Fury back in 2014 and even Jason Statham starring was a red flag after his 2023 releases  Operation Fortune  Fast X  Meg 2 and Expendables 4  Each one getting worse in quality with the Expendables 4 being borderline DTV level    Luckily I think The Beekeeper serves as a comeback for Statham and Ayer  If I wanted to be overly critical I can say the plot deals with a serious subject matter that isn t really treated with the level of seriousness it deserves to be aside from surface level statements from Statham s character here and there throughout  However on the other hand you have a very fun movie that knows what it is and you can just shut your brain off and enjoy Statham at his most ruthless maybe ever aside from 2021 s Wrath Of Man   I do appreciate two things Ayer did here for one I like how he literally made Statham this unstoppable force that no one can really stop  Statham s character sort of reminded me of John Wick here although I think even John Wick sustained more injures across one movie than Statham s character did here  I also liked how Ayer kept on upping the stakes to the point where the climax involves the President of the United States  Jeremy Irons is always great and he does a good job here  Josh Hutcherson really seems to be in the middle of a comeback and here he just plays this obnoxious douche character that you re waiting to see get what s coming to them  So overall a win for Statham after a pretty bad 2023 and a much needed win for David Ayer    This ends in a way where if Ayer and Statham wanted to make a franchise out of this they definitely could  Throughout this movie this mysterious Beekeeper organization  which Statham s character used to be a part of  is repeatedly hinted at but aside from seeing one member in action who gets dealt with pretty easily we never actually meet any of the other members who are all assumed to be on the same level of Statham s character  So I d say fuck it let s franchise this   The BeekeeperZ  to keep the bee jokes going of course ,Official Discussion,The Beekeeper,0.4803466796875

1h0uevklzema55,1h0uevk,lzema55,notamaybebutayes,2024-11-28 13:51:56 UTC,,,I don t know how  but I seem to be one of the only people who loved it   I thought the plot was fantastic and it drove home Moana s actual potential  I started getting happy tears toward the end  The music was a lot more catchy imo than the first one  I have not had a desire to rewatch or listen to the music from the first one but I would totally listen to the new sound track  The visuals were STUNNING  From the creatures to the horizons to the way the water moves and interacts with the characters  I felt like I couldn t pull my eyes away  The jokes were funny and made me laugh several times   I also just saw Wicked and don t get the hype as much as the next person  I thought it was good but I found myself not obsessed with it like most  which I really thought I would be   I don t think there is anything wrong with having a different opinion from the majority though  I m just really surprised I feel so different from others on these movies two times in a row ,Official Discussion,Wicked,0.9682077169418335

1ffg90rpost,1ffg90r,,Fit_Seesaw_8075,2024-09-12 23:13:43 UTC,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ffg90r/,11.0,Looking forward to Nosferatu but The Substance is definitely my favourite of the year so far  Funny  sexy  stylish and with glorious body horror  Going to watch again on opening night for the crowd reactions  Demi deserves an award    Text review copied below and video review version linked   https   www youtube com watch v KTbd992BzQo  https   www youtube com watch v KTbd992BzQo    Happy horror viewing       What is it    Demi Moore seeks the beauty of youth in an age reversing body horror feature  rated 18  And that was enough reason for me to park my glutes at the Odeon for their recent Scream Unseen event  When putting this review together I remembered a line said by Debbie Harry in Videodrome  we live in over stimulated times  craving stimulation for stimulation s sake  and this film certainly stimulates  Its got strong looks  big vivid sound like some sort of hardcore ASMR  killer performances in a sharp  focused script and enough of the sexy and grotesque to satisfy red blooded hardcore horror fans  Here we have  The Substance   In this  be careful what you wish for  tale  Demi Moore plays Elisabeth  a fifty something year old aerobic instructor that is past her prime in the eyes of awful TV executive Harvey  played excellently by Dennis Quaid  Harvey is a character that totally embodies the world of shit that is the Hollywood style entertainment industry and I loved to hate him and laugh at him too  Elisabeth takes a chance on an experimental drug that promises a better  younger version of yourself  However  it comes with the condition of having to switch back and forth between your two physical selves  every seen days  without exception  It s a set up to inject some criticism at showbiz  explore beauty standards and self hatred but The Substance achieves all of that whilst managing to remain darkly humorous  tense  very stylish and horrifically shocking  Bravo     Film style   The Substance boasts a bright  slick and bold visual style  at times a bit like a very bespoke modern perfume or car advert and featuring some lovely colourful costume design as well  Camera perspectives can feel clinically observational and sometimes put us in intentionally unnatural points of view  with extreme  invasive close ups of faces  warts  wrinkles and all  There are also several static shots of extremely long corridors with d cor themes possessing a sort of retro  minimalistic vision of the future  Camera angles  wallpaper and carpets very much lifted from Kubrick s The Shining  with other interiors inspired by 2001  A Space Odyssey  The Substance is an incredibly visual film that could be easily enjoyed and understood with the audio turned off   The audio design though is as equally strong as the film is to watch  It s the loudest and clearest sounding film I ve seen at the cinema in forever and sound is also utilised in such a way as to make you both laugh and squirm   intimately capturing details in moments such as the ravenous consumption of shrimps whilst watching a waitress bend over and an obnoxious phone call whilst pissing into a urinal  I loved the music  which is suitably evocative  pulsing and mechanically rhythmic courtesy of some wicked electronic tracks  A big part of the film s character are how its striking looks  impactful sound and sharp editing  accentuate and underline what s happening on screen in every moment as it presents the seemingly glamourous yet harsh  shallow world of showbiz  This approach works very well to capture a stern mood and to aggressively glue the viewers attention to its simple narrative  The Substance is a film with strong vision and execution  delivering a sense of heaviness and pressure behind Elisabeth s situation and decision to inject the mysterious bright green stuff    as green as something out of Re Animator     Personal experience  summary and reactions   Fortunately  Elisabeth s personal crisis and Demi Moore s award worthy performance help to give the viewer something humanistic and sympathetic to engage with against the film s cold  heavy presentation of a life no longer in the limelight  Her younger self  is fortunately not a garbage deep fake CGI job like something recently seen in Alien Romulus  And when Margaret Qualley as Sue is born on screen  she is distinct in personality and quickly gets high on her own fame and extreme sex appeal  I really enjoyed watching the development and consequences of their relationship unfold and didn t sense the film s 2hr 20min running time  I was later pleased to learn that its French female director received a Cannes film festival award for best screenplay  As an old school horror fan  I was very entertained when this film took a body horror nose dive until it became something I d never thought I d see in a modern cinema  After pushing its perfect ass in your face and witnessing tragic  self isolating grief  The Substance goes all in on the horror front  with superb practical effects  and just keeps giving  diving deep into the well of its own absurd and hideous potential   The finale of this film enters genre territory I m pretty sure divided the audience I was part of   a vocal crowd  with timely laughs and gasps for the first two thirds were replaced by a stiff  uncomfortable silence  This film takes its earlier measured and composed style and switches it out for something like Basket Case meets Tetsuo but with more breasts and blood  As I left the theatre  I heard comments such as  everything was really good until the ending   it s like modern cinema has gone to crap  I think might cancel my monthly membership   One girl said  I feel dirty and want a shower  to which her boyfriend replied  how can you need a shower when you spent 20  of the movie in a shower with naked Demi Moore   The Substance is surely an instant cult classic  Definitely my favourite horror movie of the year  I loved all of its brutal satire and disgusting bliss ,Review,Wicked,0.9497562646865845

bad30e582d782417c82593228c0a7bf97e777c0f  There was a new box office king  and it wasn t Mufasa or any other lion   That honor belonged to    Sonic 3     which managed to outgross    Mufasa    to top the box office  The latter still won the foreign box office  even if the numbers are way below the expectations  In limited release  A24 s    The Brutalist    had one of the best per theater averages of the year so far  While last week s newcomers     Kraven    and    The Lord of the Rings  The War of the Rohirrim    had poor drops after their anemic starts   The Top 10 earned a combined  139 7 million  That s up a massive 62  from last year  when    Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom    topped and flopped   Debuting in first place  Paramount s    Sonic the Hedgehog 3    earned  60 1 million in 3 761 theaters  That s below the  72 million debut from the previous film  but that s not really a cause for concern as of now  December titles are often known for decreasing openings but strong legs   While not a franchise best  this is still a very solid debut  As the previous film teased  the introduction of Shadow was key to the hype  Adding Keanu Reeves to the mix was also a strong choice to get the Internet going wild  It s a film where Paramount aggressively campaigned and got people talking  The fact that there were 3    Sonic    films in the span of almost five years is impressive  especially when the third film has the strongest reviews so far  While it might sound disappointing that the film didn t outperform the second film  at least it has the December excuse    According to Paramount  59  of the audience was male and 43  was in the 18 34 demographic  They gave it a strong  A  on CinemaScore  which is the same score as the previous films  Despite its lower than expected opening  it s gonna have some legs through the holidays  For now   200 million should happen  Paramount clearly believes in the franchise  they already announced development on a fourth film before the film even opened    Having to settle for second place  Disney s    Mufasa  The Lion King    earned just  35 4 million in 4 100 theaters  That s down a massive 82  from the 2019 film  which broke so many records back then  Even if we have to accept that December lowers the opening weekend numbers  that s still a horrible drop   Disney clearly believed in the potential of the 2019    Lion King    remake  After all  it earned  1 6 billion worldwide  But the thing is that the film s reputation is not the same as it was 5 years ago  The audience liked the film and ate it up  but like a lot of live action remakes  the audience moved on afterwards  All while the criticism for the 2019 film just increased    But still  how can it explain a 82  drop  Even if we have to ignore the fact that people moved on from the 2019 version  there s the fact that this is completely new story with new songs  There s no nostalgia to be milked here  and the prequel aspect is also a double edged sword  we already know Mufasa and Scar will live and eventually become enemies  Audiences can simply skip the film and won t really miss anything  unless you re insanely passionate to learn questions like    how did Rafiki got his staff  Even with the presence of a fantastic filmmaker like Barry Jenkins  you can tell this was just a paycheck  it s sitting at a weak 57  on RT  So if you didn t care or forgot about the 2019 film  there are no reasons to check this out   According to Disney  54  of the audience was female and 39  was in the 18 34 demographic  They gave it a fine  A   on CinemaScore  which is lower than the previous film  Even if the film legs out to a 6x multiplier  that would still be just  212 million  which is like 60  down from the previous film  Needless to say  it s unlikely there will be a third    Lion King    film   Universal s    Wicked    was on third place  easing just 38  and adding  14 1 million  That takes its domestic total to  384 5 million  and it should continue holding incredibly well through the holidays   After topping the box office for three weekends     Moana 2    was hit by    Sonic    and    Mufasa     The film fell to fourth place  and it had another rough drop  officially losing to    Wicked    on the weekends  This time  it fell 50   adding  13 2 million this weekend  While the film has had a huge opening weekend  the legs are leaving a lot to be desired  The film has made  359 1 million  and it has zero shot at hitting  450 million domestically  That s quite disappointing  signaling that the film was very front loaded   Angel Studios also released    Homestead    this weekend  Opening in 1 886 theaters  it earned a solid  6 million  While critics lambasted the film  the audience gave it a middling  B  on CinemaScore  It should hold well thanks to the holidays  but it would be a surprise if it came anything close to  30 million by the end of its run      Gladiator II    is still showing some legs  even if they arrived a little too late to make a difference  The film dropped 40   adding  4 5 million this weekend  The film has made  154 million so far  and the holidays should get it to around  170 million   After its pathetic debut     Kraven the Hunter    didn t save face on its second weekend  The film earned just  3 million  which marks a horrible 72  drop  almost on par with    Morbius     Through ten days  the film has made a poor  17 3 million so far  and with four films opening in wide release  it will continue falling  Even with the holidays  it d be a surprise if it made much more than  25 million domestically   Amazon s    Red One    had its worst drop so far  falling 65  and earning only  1 4 million  With more theater drops on the way  it s now guaranteed to finish below  100 million  which is quite disappointing   So    Kraven    had a horrible drop  yet    The Lord of the Rings  The War of the Rohirrim    was ready to introduce itself  It made just  1 2 million this weekend  which is a horrible 73  drop and the worst drop in the franchise  The film has earned a meager  7 3 million  and it s gonna struggle to hit  10 million lifetime  which is just pathetic  Just a few minutes ago  it was announced that the film will hit digital at home on December 27  just 2 weeks of theatrical exclusivity  Ouch      The Best Christmas Pageant Ever    rounded up the Top 10  earning  780 000 this weekend  That takes its domestic total to  38 4 million  It has a few more days to make money before completely free falling   A24 s    The Brutalist    debuted in 4 theaters  Despite its commanding 215 minute runtime  the film earned  266 791  which translates to a very strong  66 698 per theater average  third best of the year   With strong awards buzz on the way  the film will continue expanding in the coming weeks      OVERSEAS    In some consolation     Mufasa    topped the foreign box office  Even though that s by default     Sonic    didn t debut in any market  opting to start its international run on Christmas   With that out of the way     Mufasa    debuted with  87 2 million in the overseas markets  for a  122 2 million worldwide debut  That s far below the projected  180 million debut  and a far cry from the original  It had soft debuts across the world  with its best numbers in China   7 8M   France   7 7M   Mexico   7 1M   the UK   5 5M  and Germany   5M   Even with the benefit of holidays  it s tough to see the film making much more than  600 million worldwide  more than  1 billion below the 2019 title  Which means it will break the record for the biggest sequel to original drop      Moana 2    added  32 8 million this weekend  as its worldwide total is nearing  800 million  The best markets so far are France   46M   UK   37 6M   Germany   29M   Mexico   26 2M  and Brazil   24M   That billion is gonna take a few more weeks      Wicked    added  12 6 million this weekend  taking its worldwide total to  572 million  The best markets are the UK   60 8M   Australia   22 5M   Korea   13 1M   Mexico   9 6M  and Germany   8M     In some notable news     Gladiator II    has finally crossed  400 million worldwide  with a  416 3 million run so far      FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK    None      THIS WEEK    We ll have four films hitting wide release   The first is Robert Eggers  new film    Nosferatu     a remake of the 1922 film  Eggers is coming off    The Northman     which was his highest grossing film  Even though it wasn t theatrically successful  it was reported that it broke even through ancilliaries  which is why this film exists  Pre sales are very strong for its opening day  and with fantastic reviews so far  it looks like Eggers might have a new highest grossing film   Another release is Searchlight s    A Complete Unknown     which stars Timoth e Chalamet as Bob Dylan  The film has earned very good reviews  but Chalamet has received acclaim so far  building strong awards buzz  Perhaps we re looking at another sleeper hit   A24 is also releasing    Babygirl     which stars Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson  Once again  another title with decent reviews so far  and Kidman earning Oscar buzz for her performance   The final title is Amazon s    The Fire Inside     which marks Rachel Morrison s directorial debut  written by Barry Jenkins  The film stars Ryan Destiny and Brian Tyree Henry  and follows the true story of American professional boxer Claressa  T Rex  Shields as she trains for the 2012 Summer Olympics  Amazon s    The Boys in the Boat    performed quite well last year  so perhaps this could surprise                                                                                                 If you re interested in following the box office  come join us in r

1d1kyg2l5uxt15,1d1kyg2,l5uxt15,Only-Entertainer-573,2024-05-27 08:51:04 UTC,,,Marcus Aurelius  was  wise and honourable   Famously  one of the wisest people who ever lived  https   en wikipedia org wiki Meditations   even  But he was also just a human being after all   I think in that part of the movie  the small part of the movie he is in   he is  mindful    and acknowledges his faults and regrets   perhaps even a little more harshly than he ought to have   in the end stages of his life   He considered his duty first and foremost to be being the emperor  Presumably this would have necessitated some degree of neglect towards his children  He would have been preoccupied with going off and fighting wars and talking to the senate just generally running the empire much of the time  He would not have had a lot of time to raise his children  and presumably their mother and many of his slaves would have had a much more active role in doing so   So it s not quite like he was a deliberately and wilfully absent father   it s just that his circumstances probably all but demanded it  But he still regrets the effect this had on his children   I think Lucilla was probably mature enough to have grown to have a lot of understanding about this  She said that line  sure  But she obviously still loved the man    or at least didn t bear him any particular ill will  If anything I think she was just sort of patiently indulging him in sharing his final thoughts about their relationship  That might just be the sort of thing that he typically said    and she might not have really agreed with it  but was just having a playful conversation  That sort of thing   Obviously Commodus wasn t quite on the same page  though  His conversation with Marcus went a little differently   That was my interpretation of the whole thing  in terms of what it meant in the movie   anyway    Of course         it goes without saying that all of this was to serve the narrative story  of the movie    and doesn t necessarily represent the real feelings and actions of these real historical people  Lol   In  real  life  Marcus Aurelius and his wife Faustina had at least 14 children during their 30 year marriage  including two sets of twins  That s not in the movie  Commodus didn t assassinate Marcus Aurelius either  Or at least    he was already named Imperator  by Marcus Aurelius  about 4 years before Marcus Aurelius even died  which essentially means that Aurelius did choose him as his successor  although the succession inevitably became complicated   Commodus actually had a decently long reign and it wasn t  all  bad  so the movie did him a bit of a disservice  Although       Cassius Dio  a first hand witness  describes him as   not naturally wicked but  on the contrary  as guileless as any man that ever lived  His great simplicity  however  together with his cowardice  made him the slave of his companions  and it was through them that he at first  out of ignorance  missed the better life and then was led on into lustful and cruel habits  which soon became second nature       His recorded actions do tend to show a rejection of his father s policies  his father s advisers  and especially his father s austere lifestyle  and an alienation from the surviving members of his family  It seems likely that he was raised in an atmosphere of Stoic asceticism  which he rejected entirely upon his accession to sole rule   Lucilla in real life was the Empress Augusta with her first husband  co emperor Lucius Verus for a few years  long before Commodus was  and  during  the reign of Marcus Aurelius   But this was when she was like   13 years old  She was no longer the Empress when her husband died  Later  she was indeed involved in a coup d etat plot to assassinate overthrow her brother Commodus  somewhat like the third act of the movie    but it was to replace him with herself and her second husband Quintianus  The plot was foiled and she was banished to the island of Capri for her involvement in it  Although her banishment only lasted about a year before Commodus had her secretly executed by a centurion anyway   Maximus was not a real person at all AFAIK   So yeah   the real history was far more complicated and less narratively and emotionally satisfying than the story in the movie ,Discussion,Wicked,0.5301558971405029

1c5nzorkzvm4xe,1c5nzor,kzvm4xe,Rita_Mcjunkins,2024-04-16 19:43:10 UTC,,,The film s severe conclusion is something I like since it presents a realistic and brutal image of the reality that many people must endure  Justice is messy  expensive  and occasionally tragically unfinished  it isn t always presented with a bow on top  Because of the protagonist s fate  viewers are forced to face the harsh reality that  for some  making a great sacrifice is the only way to bring the system s abusers and enablers to light  It s a harsh example of how society fails to defend the weak and punish the wicked without requiring a terrifying wake up call  Moreover  the conclusion serves as a commentary on the viewer in addition as outlining the antagonists  We feel uneasy because it should  That unease we experience  Here is where the discussion about what justice actually ought to look like starts  encouraging us to think critically  ask questions  and  ideally  take action instead of just watching ,Spoilers,Wicked,0.552030622959137

1h95qylm17rm0f,1h95qyl,m17rm0f,eregyrn,2024-12-09 16:41:51 UTC,,,Really recommend watching it   It was an early use of Technicolor in film  not the first use  but the way it used it was striking    First big role for Judy Garland   At the time  it was the biggest adaptation of what was already an enormously popular book series  that had had stage adaptations prior to this   The music was hugely popular   The costuming of the Wicked Witch of the West  and her green skin  basically created the iconic look of Halloween witches in American popular culture for years to come   I was discussing this recently  and I think I counted up over 30 phrases from the film that have entered popular vernacular  and which are still used today   That includes both lines from the movie  concepts from the movie  and parts of the songs    That s a LOT compared to a film like Casablanca  which also gave a bunch of phrases to popular culture  but only around 11 or so    I think you re right that as time goes on  especially due to the fragmenting of the media landscape  the movie itself will have less of a footprint in popular culture   But its enormous footprint continued to be really strong basically up until the streaming era started   Already  I ve seen some reaction videos to it on YT in which the people watching it remark several times   This is what that s from    So the phrases  concepts  and even songs may remain in popular culture  and some of the images probably will  like the iconic design of witches   but increasingly  people won t know they originated with this movie    Since a growing number of people already don t    I think it would be difficult for a film to attain that degree of cultural saturation these days   The Wizard of Oz was shown on broadcast television  in the pre cable era  and after   every year  from the 60s through the 80s at least   Before VCRs  and before cable  and long before streaming  when people only had access to 5 or 6 channels  almost all kids would have viewed it multiple times  and it would have been one of the only movies they had that experience with ,News,Wicked,0.9489132761955261

1gtrl2olxphwgk,1gtrl2o,lxphwgk,bertilac-attack,2024-11-18 04:25:10 UTC,,,Demi would have my vote for sure  not just for inclusion  but quite possibly for the win  The Substance was the watch for the year for me  but I don t think it s the kind of movie the Academy is capable of accepting    Toni Collette s magnum opus in Hereditary couldn t make the final five in one of the weakest years in Best Actress in recent memory  had she been nominated against eventual winner Renee Zellweger in Judy  she would likely today be Academy Award Winner Toni Collette    But this year we are FEASTING  It truly is one of the most riveting Best Actress slates we ve had in my lifetime  There are more than ten performances that are real  quality  reasonable  contenders   three I m super confident in  and of course a couple others that are making big plays at the nomination   The safest bet in Best Actress is    Mikey Madison  for Anora    Sidebar  this is the performance of the year  she is absolutely the frontrunner for  and will probably win  the Oscar for Best Actress   She s also my most confident bet for the Golden Globe and Critics Choice  we ll see if she can hold strong at BAFTA and SAG    The safe bets are   Angelina Jolie  for Maria    Karla Sofia Gascon  for Emilia Perez  Unless Emilia Perez proves divisive enough to notably underperform on nominations morning  both these women are getting nominated  Emilia Perez is gonna clock in between 3 9 nominations  I d wager   probably also making Picture  Supporting Actress  Zoe Saliva   and Screenplay  if not also Director  and then some    Maria  like Jackie and Spencer before it  has proved polarizing as well   but Kristen Stewart made the final five for Spencer  which was about as close to a proper Horror nomination as we ve gotten in a long time  I think that film was likely much more alienating to the average academy member than Maria    Every critic and industry watcher I follow is confident Angelina makes the final five  this is her best performance in years and industry people are eager to recognize that  She s also playing a real person in a Pablo Larrain film  that s baity  the Academy is absolutely going for her  I have even read a couple critics say they think she could potentially surprise and win    To be clear  I don t think Jolie can win  Maria is not likely to be a widely nominated film  probably three or four noms tops  and she could even end up its sole nomination   As a counterpoint to those saying she could win  my favourite critic describes Jolie s performance as  empty   and  lots of posing   so I don t think this is shaping up to be the uniformly hailed tour de force some were anticipating     Also on the table for inclusion in the final five  we have the following eight women duelling for two spots   Marianne Jean Baptiste  for Hard Truths    Nicole Kidman  for Babygirl    Saoirse Ronan  for The Outrun    Fernanda Torres  for I m Still Here    Amy Adams  for Nightbitch    Cynthia Erivo  for Wicked   And finally  Tilda Swinton and Julianne Moore  for The Room Next Door  I ve got them arranged most to least likely  My two spots would go to Kidman and Demi Moore or Marianne Jean Baptiste  though I WISH Torres could get nominated here  I m Still Here may be a player in a few other categories  so we ll see   if there s to be a spoiler this year  I don t see it being Demi   I see it being Fernanda   Her mother  Fernanda Montenegro  should have won best actress in 1999 when Harvey Weinstein bought Gwyneth a trophy  a nomination here would be exquisite karma     Ronan was an early front runner for me this year  but The Outrun has completely fallen off the map   she s more likely to be nominated in Supporting for Blitz   and if I m going to pick a performance that will absolutely be its films  sole nomination  I m going with Kidman in Babygirl   which is  like Jolie  her best performance in YEARS    I do think both Dickinson and Banderas are worthy of Supporting Actor nods for their work in Babygirl   but I don t think there s room for either  I d also love to see it make Picture  it was another favourite of mine this year  but I m not confident it breaks the final ten there  Kidman was nominated for a far inferior performance  and a divisive one  in Being The Ricardos   I think Babygirl has her closer to a second Oscar win than she has ever been    In fact  if a surprise second win for a seasoned vet is in the cards  I d actually bet on Kidman over Jolie   though I must stress  Madison is taking Best Actress  Anora is absolutely sensational and is really the only film giving The Brutalist any challenge in Best Picture  Mikey Madison is winning this   Amy Adams isn t getting nominated at the Oscars for Nightbitch  she didn t make the final five for Arrival in a not great year in Best Actress  I don t think Nightbitch can carry her there  But I expect her to hang on at precursors as late as SAG  and I do think in a lesser year   like again  2019   she could ve cracked the top five   Erivo suffers from the choice to split Wicked in two  and the early word is Grande is the performance of the film  I m not sure there s room in Supporting Actress for her either  but I m way less confident that Erivo makes the cut here  Wicked would have to be REALLY good   I d actually be more surprised than if Demi made the cut   Demi has the buzziest surprise of the year  Wicked feels like a redux of The Colour Purple last year  But it s important to keep in mind  this big colourful movie is coming down the pipeline and the studio is making big plays for nominations in all the big categories  She s definitely on the table  and will for sure be nominated in places like The Globes along the way   Moore and Swinton are missing out this year  Swinton especially   she s another classic case of a performance on the line between Lead and Supporting that could ve cleaned up nicely had she campaigned in Supporting  probably winning a couple trophies on the way to second place at Oscar  But her choice to campaign in Lead  as her costar Moore did  doomed the film to irrelevance  There s not room for one of them in this category  this year  let alone two    For my personal taste  I d take Madison   Demi  Moore  Jean Baptiste  Kidman  and Torres    Madison should win  but I would vote for Moore out of both a despicable sense of familiarity and camaraderie  and a commendable sense of adoration for The Substance  That s my Best Picture this year   I m happy to see Jolie thrive  but Larrain s films of historical ladies are always missing a little something for me  so I wouldn t weep too hard to see her left out in favour of Kidman  Jean Baptiste  and especially Torres   all of whom were in films I preferred ,Spoilers,Wicked,0.6297559142112732

1gzy9p9lz25op9,1gzy9p9,lz25op9,Critical_Town_7724,2024-11-26 11:30:59 UTC,,,Great that you mention Billy Wilder  I was literally thinking about him yesterday  I m working on a list of what I believe to be the 100 best movies of all time  and so far  there are five Billy Wilder movies on it  That got me wondering  is Billy Wilder the greatest director of all time  If not  he s certainly close  The man did everything  seriously  everything  He tackled almost every genre  well  not horror    unless you count Fedora as kind of horror    and he succeeded every single time   And let s talk about his life story  Wilder is the American Dream  He was a journalist in Berlin who had to flee Nazi Germany because of his Jewish heritage  He lived in Mexico for a while  trying to get into the U S   but was denied multiple times  He d tell them he was a writer  and they d just send him back  Eventually  he made it  He got a job at MGM  and get this he had a sign in his office that read   What would Lubitsch do   Yes  as in Ernst Lubitsch  his idol  And guess what  He made that dream a reality when he worked with Lubitsch  co writing Ninotchka   For his directorial debut  The Major and the Minor  he somehow convinced Ginger Rogers  the reigning Best Actress Oscar winner  to star  Wilder went on to direct screwball comedies  thrillers  war dramas  romantic comedies  you name it  He didn t just dabble in genres  he mastered them  When the studio pressured him to soften his portrayal of German soldiers in Stalag 17  because they didn t want them all painted as  evil    he finished the movie and left the studio  because this man wouldn t compromise his beliefs   Here s more  after WWII  when he went to Europe to search for his family  whom he then discovered had all been killed   Wilder worked as a war correspondent  capturing footage of destroyed Germany  That same material became the basis for his film A Foreign Affair  which  true to form  didn t shy away from addressing the questionable behavior of American troops during the occupation   Wilder wasn t just a filmmaker  He was a social critic  a visionary  and an example of what hard work and conviction can achieve  And yet  he also had a wicked sense of humor and a love of cinema that shines in every project  His work is thoughtful  sharp  and consistently excellent  so much so that it s honestly sad to see him overlooked in discussions like this  Thank you again for mentioning him        Excuse me for the long rant  but for me  Wilder is a prime candidate for the most consistently great filmmaker  His career is astonishing  and his legacy deserves more recognition  Even though Wilder made a few less memorable films out of an astonishing 26  there s nothing in his filmography that could be considered outright bad  But  you know  nobody s perfect ,Discussion,Wicked,0.8879086971282959

14gzxwmjp975qg,14gzxwm,jp975qg,1daytogether,2023-06-23 18:38:26 UTC,,,Well the classic kung fu movie really started with  King Hu  working under the Shaw Brothers Studio in the 60s  when he directed the seminal   Come Drink with Me    His follow up works    Dragon Gate Inn   and a   Touch of Zen    are just as seminal  But they are swordplay fantasies  In terms of more grounded hand to hand that s more common   Jimmy Wang Yu  kicked off the craze with   The Chinese Boxer    a film that would be copied by Shaw as a template for the entire rest of their existence  He also did some swordplay stuff  most notably   The One Armed Swordsman trilogy     Then in the 70s  the genre really exploded  Leading the fray was prolific director  Chang Chah   Examples of his early work are   Vengeance       The Duel    and   Boxer from Shantung    They are very bloody and explosive in violence  He became known with his collaboration with a particular set of actors in a series of films starting with   Five Deadly Venoms    But there were other great directors  my favorite of the bunch being  Lau Kar Leung   He s a great storyteller who knows how to balance humor with humanism  and his fight choreography is second to none  His great films include   36th Chamber of Shaolin      Heroes of the East      My Young Auntie      Dirty Ho    and   8 Diagram Pole Fighter    Other great and prominent directors of Shaw include  Chor Yuen     The Magic Blade      Sun Chung     Avenging Eagle  A Fist Full of Talons     and  Chi Kuei Hung     Killer Constable  Boxer s Omen     Notable films not made by famous directors include   Super Inframan      Holy Flame of the Martial World    and   Five Fingers of Death    and would showcase how Shaw movies blended kung fu with horror  surrealism  and even superheroes   Outside the Shaw system  there were others  like  Joseph Kuo  and an early Golden Harvest  where legendary fight choreographers like  Yuen Woo Ping  would team up with  Jackie Chan  to make   Snake in the Eagle s Shadow   before their seminal   Drunken Master     Sammo Hung  was getting his feet wet  and his best work during the 70s is   Magnificent Butcher     Yuen Biao  was also a rising star    Prodigal Son   being a great showcase for him  There were female oriented movies too  like  Angela Mao  s   Hapkido   and   Lady Whirlwind    Obviously   Bruce Lee  disrupted everything  and for me his best film is   Fist of Fury   aka Chinese Connection    Enter the Dragon   is a major highlight too   There s a lot of stuff I missed in the 70s  but since this is already an insanely long post  I ll jump to the 80s  where Shaw Bros were dying and Golden Harvest became the dominant studio that made everything  Period kung fu movies started to die out  and modern action movies with kung fu were in  Nothing exemplifies 80s Hong Kong better than the collabs between  Jackie  Sammo   and  Biao   They are    Project A      Meals on Wheels    and   Dragons Forever    Their solo outings are arguably even better  the cream of the crop being   Police Story      Eastern Condors    and   Righting Wrongs      Tiger Cage 1   2   are other examples of 80s modern action with kung fu in it   Michelle Yeoh  and  Cynthia Rothrock   came into prominence  leading a wave of action known as Girls with Guns    Royal Warriors      Yes  Madam      In the Line of Duty 3   4      She Shoots Straight    and   Iron Angels   are some great examples  Meanwhile  some groundbreaking directors were busy trying to revitalize the classic kung fu movie   Tsui Hark   we ll see him again later  with   Butterfly Murders     Tony Ching Siu Tung  with   Duel to the Death     Corey Yuen  with   Ninja in the Dragon s Den     By the time we get to the 90s   Tsui Hark  and  Jet Li  would dominate the landscape with his historical epic   trilogy of Once Upon a Time in China   starring  Jet Li   It was so successful it would spawn a 4th and 5th installment plus a rooster themed unofficial spin off by  Wong Jing  and a spaghetti western one by  Sammo Hung  but they are not as good  Hark would also go completely nuts with a violent and arthouse reimagining of the One Armed Swordsman called   The Blade    His adaptation of a classic novel in   The Swordsman trilogy   is phantasmagoric  His success meant period kung fu was back with a vengeance  and  Yuen Woo Ping  took his turn with   Iron Monkey   and   Tai Chi Master     Corey Yuen  would have some success with   The Legend   duology also starring  Jet Li   Be sure to watch The   Bride with White Hair   duology from Ronny Yu  a night for day orgy of giallo lit wuxia    Fist of Legend   might be the best pure kung fu movie of the 90s  with of course   Jet Li  Jackie Chan  was busy making sequels to all his hits  and most of them were great  including   Operation Condor      Police Story 3    and   Drunken Master 2    Even Wong Kar Wai joined the fray with   Ashes of Time    a confusing but beautiful contemplation on martial arts mythos  For something more modern  try sleazy  comic book movies like   Black Mask  Wicked City    and   Naked Killer     The 2000s  after all the top talented directors and actors fled to the US to make movies   Stephen Chow   who had been making mostly comedies  made two masterpieces that might be the kung fu movies to end all kung fu movies    Shaolin Soccer   and   Kung Fu Hustle     Donnie Yen  and director  Wilson Ip  held the fort  and reminded that Hong Kong could still make great kung fu action movies with   SPL Killzone      Flash Point    and   Ip Man     Benny Chan  also made an excellent film around this time with some youngsters called   Invisible Target    That was arguably the end of kung fu action movies  and the shift of production would move to Mainland China  where extravagant epics like   Hero       The Banquet  Brotherhood of Blades duology   would take over  Today  there are tons of kung fu movies made every year  but they are coming out of the the straight to streaming world in China  nobody is documenting them and there are no subtitles  Other countries like Vietnam  Thailand  Indonesia  Japan  and Korea would try to fill the gap a bit  My favorites from these pan asian countries are    Man from Nowhere      Versus      Crows Zero      Chocolate      The Protector    and   The Rebel     By the time you get to the 2010s  kung fu movies were dead did but that didn t stop  Garath Evans  from making   The Raid duology   and  Scott Adkins  working with  Issac Florentine  to make the DTV masterpieces that are   Undisputed 3   and   Ninja 2    Hong Kong squeezed out one last kung fu action masterpiece    SPL 2     If you wanna see some choice cuts of early kung fu movies  take a look at the Shout Factory and Arrow Video Shaw Box Sets  You don t have to buy them  but check out their picks  Arrow has their own streaming channel where a of of them can be found  Hi Yah is another streaming channel dedicated to martial arts movies  you can check that out  Most of the movies I listed are available on blu ray  For some really deep dive understanding  take a gander at Planet Hong Kong  a book by film scholar David Bordwell  It s an old book at this point  but since Hong Kong s cinema boom effectively ended in the 90s  it s still relevant  And there s my crash course  Hope you feel more like an expert now  Remember this is just the tip of the iceberg   EDIT  Fixed some formatting and omissions ,Discussion,Wicked,0.6575131416320801

 39       6 112 534    7 083 173   N A  To say that it was a great Thanksgiving weekend would be selling it short      Moana 2    surpassed every expectation and delivered a record breaking debut for the Thanksgiving weekend  And with the aid of    Wicked    and    Gladiator II     it was the busiest weekend of the year   The Top 10 earned a combined  269 2 million this weekend   412 8 million five day   That s not just a colossal 210  up from last year  but it s also the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever   Debuting on top     Moana 2    earned a colossal  139 7 million in 4 200 theaters  Adding its numbers from Wednesday  the debut rises to  225 4 million in five days  It broke so many records  including the biggest debut for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film debut  as well as the highest Thanksgiving weekend  But most importantly  it beat    The Super Mario Bros  Movie      204 6 million  for the biggest Wednesday to Sunday debut    A fantastic debut all around  and it shouldn t be a surprise  If you ve followed the Top 10 charts on streaming  you ll find that    Moana    has been one of the most streamed films in the past years  It was even reported that it was the most streamed film across all services last year  Needless to say     Moana    became far more popular with years  and audiences hoped for a sequel to come   Disney  for some reason  was interested in doing it but only as a TV show for Disney   In February 2024  it was revealed that the show was retooled into a film that would hit theaters this Thanksgiving  With an extensive marketing campaign  Disney successfully got people into giving this film a chance    According to Disney  65  of the audience was female  and 60  was 18 and over  Critics were not enthused with the film  and it currently sits at 64  on RT  The audience was more forgiving  giving it an  A   on CinemaScore  although that falls on the lower end of WDAS titles  There are no animated titles on its way until    Dog Man    in January  so it can leg out through the holidays   500 million is pretty much guaranteed  and can go as high as  600 million if it can hold very well   After defying gravity on its opening weekend     Wicked    continued flying high  It earned  81 1 million this weekend   118 2 million five day   That marks an insane 28  drop  which breaks the record set by    Top Gun  Maverick     29   as the smallest drop for a  100  million opener  Of course     Maverick    achieved that record on the weekend after Memorial Day  but it didn t face a  100  million opener on its second weekend   Through ten days     Wicked    has earned a colossal  263 1 million domestically  It s already the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation  passing    Grease      188 million   Of course     Grease    is still ahead in terms of adjusted inflation   770 million   but    Wicked    remains a colossal success  It should hit  400 million without any problem  and the holidays can help it get close to  500 million by the end of its run   Paramount s    Gladiator II    added  31 million this weekend  That represents a 44  drop  which is fine  but not fantastic considering how well the other holdovers did  Through 10 days  Ridley Scott s sequel has earned  111 4 million  passing    Robin Hood    and    Black Hawk Down    to become Scott s 6th highest grossing film domestically  The film should finish with over  150 million domestically  quite down from the original s  187 million lifetime gross   After a steep second weekend drop  Amazon MGM s    Red One    eased a light 4   adding  12 7 million this weekend  The film has earned  75 8 million so far  and depending on next week s drop  it could still hit  100 million  Although it s hard to call this a bonafide hit considering its colossal  250 million budget   Lionsgate s    The Best Christmas Pageant Ever    was still on the Top 5  easing just 6  and adding  3 2 million  The film has earned  31 9 million domestically   In sixth place  Angel Studios     Bonhoeffer  Pastor  Spy  Assassin    fell 54  and added  2 3 million this weekend   3 3 million five day   That s a very weak drop  especially considering it had Thanksgiving  Through ten days  the film has amassed  9 6 million and will close with less than  15 million      Venom  The Last Dance    is still holding well  dipping 43  this weekend and adding  2 2 million  The film has amassed  137 8 million so far  which is still far behind the previous    Venom    films   A24 s    Heretic    continues falling  This weekend  it fell 57  and added  956K this weekend  With  26 8 million in the bank  it s now gonna finish below  30 million   In the face of    Moana 2     DreamWorks     The Wild Robot    had its worst drop yet  It collapsed 67  this weekend  adding  700 000 to its run  The film has earned  142 5 million  and it s nearing the end of its run   Rounding up the Top 10 was Searchlight s    A Real Pain     which recovered after its weak drop last weekend  The film dipped 39   grossing  655 910 this weekend  The film has earned just  6 1 million  and barring some huge Oscar noms  it looks like it might miss  10 million   Outside the Top 10 was Focus Features     Conclave     which dipped 46  and earned  616 955 this weekend  That takes its domestic total to  30 1 million domestically  A damn great run for an adult drama   Neon s    Anora    is winding down  and it s now playing in just 230 theaters  This weekend  it dipped 43  and added  385 292  Its domestic total stands at  12 7 million   A24 debuted Luca Guadagnino s    Queer    in 7 theaters  earning  188 808  That translates to a  26 973 per theater average  which is quite middling  it barely cracks the top 20 highest PTA of the year   For comparison  it s barely above    Bones and All      24 201   and far below    Suspiria      92 019  and    Call Me By Your Name      103 233   The film will continue expanding through the holidays      OVERSEAS    The records don t stop just in America for    Moana 2         Moana 2    debuted with a colossal  163 million overseas  which means it debuted with  389 2 million worldwide  That broke    Mario    s record   377 million  for the biggest animated debut in history  The biggest markets were France   18 8M   UK   15 5M   Mexico   11 1M   Germany   10 5M   Italy   9 3M   South Korea   9 1M   Australia   8 3M   Brazil   7 5M   China   6 5M  and Spain   5 5M   An easy billion right here  ladies and gentlemen       Wicked    is a monster hit domestically  but that popularity hasn t fully connected with the rest of the world  This weekend  the film earned  29 million from the overseas markets  taking the worldwide total to  360 3 million  It s still killing it in the UK   36M  and Australia   12 9M   and it has performed well in South Korea   8 5M   Mexico   6 7M   and Philippines   3 5M   The rest of the markets    not so much  While it still has some markets left  the film will be domestic heavy  The film is cleary a hit  but it s crazy how the domestic market represents a huge 73  of its worldwide gross      Gladiator II    added  27 2 million this weekend  and its worldwide total is now  320 2 million  The best markets are the UK   29 7M   France   22 5M   Spain   15M   Mexico   12 9M  and Australia   11 5M   The film should pass the original s  272 million foreign gross  but it s unlikely it can pass its worldwide gross   460 million       FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK    Movie   Release Date   Studio   Domestic Opening   Domestic Total   Worldwide Total   Budget

 closed with a fantastic  294 million domestically  finishing as Burton s second highest grossing film  just a little behind    Alice in Wonderland      334 million   Interestingly  that popularity wasn t as strong overseas  as the domestic market represented 65 3  of its worldwide gross  It s still a great  450 million worldwide  although    Alice      1 billion  and    Charlie and the Chocolate Factory      474 million  finished far higher  Despite a few duds here and there  Tim Burton is still as popular as he s ever been        Saturday Night Live    might be popular 50 years later  but that doesn t mean the audience is interested in a film depicting its first ever broadcast  That was the case for Jason Reitman s    Saturday Night     which closed with a very poor  9 5 million domestically  The film was positioned as an Oscars contender  but the film fizzled out by the time it hit wide release and faded quickly  Don t expect the rest of the world to save it  given that    Saturday Night Live    isn t as popular as the States      Last month  we had two movies revolving around a clown as its protagonist     Joker  Folie   Deux    became one of the worst received comic book films of all time  allowing Art the Clown to emerge as the winner of the month  And now     Terrifier 3    has closed with a damn fantastic  94 million worldwide  making it the highest grossing unrated film ever  Shattered the ceilling of what a film like this could achieve  and elevating Art to one of the most iconic horror villains of modern times  Damien Leone has already confirmed a fourth film is coming up  Art in space when      THIS WEEKEND    The post Thanksgiving weekend is usually a dumping ground for studios  With the Christmas season kicking off  people are busy  which is why studios avoid releasing anything big  It s up to the small films to get a chance  This weekend  we have two newcomers and none of them stand a chance in dethroning    Moana 2     None will even touch  10 million this weekend   The only one with a confirmed wide release is A24 s    Y2K     which marks Kyle Mooney s debut as writer and director  The film stars Jaeden Martell  Julian Dennison  Rachel Zegler  Fred Durst  and Alicia Silverstone  and depicts an imaginative version of the Year 2000 problem  where a bug causes all technology to come to life and turn against humanity  The film has received mixed reviews  63  on RT   and horror comedies have not performed well as of late  We ll see how it does  but a debut under A24 s    Heretic      10 8 million  seems pretty much imminent   The other film  although in far less theaters  is Searchlight s    Nightbitch     A film that stars Amy Adams as a mother who transforms into a dog  Like  seriously  Y all complain about lack of originality in Hollywood  Well  here s a very unique premise  Reviews are quite similar to    Y2K     and marketing has been very limited so far  This suggests it won t be a very wide release   And for those curious  Christopher Nolan s    Interstellar    is returning to theaters this Friday for a limited time on IMAX screens  You should hurry up  for screenings are quickly getting sold out                                                                                                 If you re interested in following the box office  come join us in r BoxOffice

1aom6kikq0n4gq,1aom6ki,kq0n4gq,Oobidanoobi,2024-02-12 01:12:31 UTC,,,  There s no reason to make this two movies   I completely disagree  IMO this is the single most justified  two parter adaptation  since the trend s inception   Wicked is a show of two halves  and those two halves are about as different as it s possible for two halves of the same story to be  Tonally  Act 1 is a lighthearted enemies to friends teen comedy in a magic highschool  whereas Act 2 is a dark semi political fantasy thriller with Shakespearean tragedy vibes  Act 1 takes place mostly in a single location  whereas Act 2 hops around a vast fantasy world  Act 1 is paced quite slowly  whereas Act 2 runs a marathon a minute  and could really do with some extra time to flesh ideas out   Act 1 has almost nothing to do with The Wizard of Oz  whereas Act 2 is a direct retelling  There s a time skip of several years between the two acts  Oh  and Act 1 ends with by far the show s most climactic sequence  which would make the rest of the story feel insanely underwhelming without some kind of break   There is just no goddamn way you could adapt the story of Wicked as a single film  Even if it ran three hours  the pacing of the musical s narrative is simply incompatible with moviegoers  expectations  You cannot tell a near complete  emotionally satisfying narrative  end with a massive climax  then expect audiences to sit still for another seventy minutes to watch a second distinct narrative with a wildly different tone and scope   This is the exact same problem Into the Woods had  It s not an issue of runtime  it s an issue of structure ,Trailer,Wicked,0.7075940370559692

1gycenylyqvy0y,1gyceny,lyqvy0y,Diechswigalmagee,2024-11-24 14:52:58 UTC,,,  It s definitely a prequel   It s not a prequel     If you ve ever read any of the Baum books about Oz  his own work contradicts itself  One book  the Wizard is evil  the next he s a good guy with no explanation as to why   1  IMHO  the Wizard is never depicted as evil in the Baum books  He is a somewhat background antagonistic force in The Marvelous Land of Oz  but he isn t so much  evil  in it as he is selfish    2  Yes  the Baum books contradicted themselves at times  But they were consistent in character names  backstories  and relationships for their main cast  which Wicked completely ignores    Boq is now the Tin Man  not Nick Chopper  and he was turned that way on accident by the Wicked Witch of the West and not by a malicious spell from the Wicked Witch of the East   Fiyero is the Scarecrow   at least in the musical  in the book it is left somewhat ambiguous   and he either never becomes ruler of Oz  instead leaving Oz forever   or he maybe becomes ruler of Oz but is actually probably just a fake after the real Scarecrow died    The Cowardly Lion s name is Brrr  and instead of staying with Dorothy s group across the Baum sequels and playing minor and major roles throughout the series he instead joins a circus   Dorothy    well the less said about Dorothy s character the better lol   Wicked very purposefully changes almost every detail about the characters besides their names  It s one thing to have slight inconsistencies across 14 novels  It s another to basically upend the entire story  It isn t a prequel  it s a complete reimagining of the world in which Oz is set   Wicked is like Theseus s Paradox lol  If you replace every character and world detail in a story  is it still the same story ,News,Wicked,0.604278564453125

movies 39 times this year and  utm source share utm medium web3x utm name web3xcss utm term 1 utm content share button   This is now my third year doing something like this  and I really enjoyed talking to people last year about where my movies fell versus where they felt things needed to land  There were definitely a few criticisms last year that I d like to clear up beforehand     I do view myself as a  typical moviegoer  and don t see myself as a cinephile at all    My wife and I tend to go during the weekends at daytime hours  it s just our preference  which does limit us sometimes with movies that aren t as popular and are in their 3rd 4th week of a run    There are a lot of movies we d like to see but don t get around to just because a smaller release happens during a time where we re very busy and don t get to the theater for a few weeks    Many of you were critical of the fact that I often took small naps during movies   It never bothered me  but I did find out that I was vitamin D deficient early this year  and taking vitamins has helped out a lot   This list does include movies from 2023 that I either saw at the beginning of 2024  or we saw in 2023 after releasing my list last year     A Quick Note on Categories     Other than  Favorite of the Year  I don t particularly have other categories ranked top to bottom in terms of favorite  There are movies in the  Enjoyed it  but Probably Wouldn t Watch Again  category that I liked better than movies in the  Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again  category  but I prefer fun and more relaxed movies for multiple viewings     Favorite of the Year  Ranked in Order       My Old Ass    I expected to like this one  as a comedy     But I came out of the theater with tears in my eyes  Yea sure it s about a drug induced romp   on the surface    but as I get older I feel this one really spoke to me on a deeper level      We Live in Time    I don t know if I ll ever watch it again  It doesn t strike me as the type of movie that I am going to want to watch a second time  just because of the subject nature and how deeply sad it is     But it moved me pretty significantly as is the second time I ve ever found myself crying at a movie theater      Lisa Frankenstein    I was surprised to learn some people really hated this one  because I think it was the perfect amount of fun    and weird     and campy     I Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again      Deadpool   Wolverine    It s just a fun love letter of a movie  right  I don t go to a Deadpool movie expecting everything to make sense  I just want a good old fashioned 4th wall breaking bromance  and this movie delivers      Saturday Night    The movie has a very frenetic energy to it and didn t give me a lot of breathing room to process different things going on  which is something that I typically don t enjoy  For some reason   maybe it s the fact that I do watch SNL and kind of have that expectation anyway   it just works  and I d probably want to watch it again to see what nuances I might pick up on      Inside Out 2    Inside Out 2 does a far better job   in my opinion   of being a fun Disney sequel than Moana 2 does  I think I d need to watch both entries of this franchise back to back to really decide which one I like better      Heretic    I don t know if I ever thought I d see Hugh Grant in a horror movie like this  It hits all the notes that I expect from the genre  but I really liked the Book of Mormon x Horror vibe  and the almost chess like mentality his villain hits throughout the entire movie      Fly Me to the Moon    We live in a time where people just make shit up  so even though this takes place before the moon landing  it still sort of felt topical     Except it s also a very funny comedy      Speak No Evil    I m writing this after writing a few other similar thoughts further down the list   Once again  another movie that feels totally ruined by the trailers    Why do they keep doing this to us  Except it honestly doesn t even matter  The movie just works    I d watch it 10 more times just to see if I pick up on anything in the background     Enjoyed Far More Than I Expected      Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes    I saw and enjoyed the first remake but have become disillusioned by the movies with each passing sequel  I really didn t think this would be very interesting  but was happily very surprised      Civil War    Given the political climate of The United States around the time that this started to promo release  I was very nervous as to this one having a bullshit political agenda   for either side    Given that it did not  and took steps to really make sure the audience couldn t try to pull an agenda out of it  I was able to fully enjoy the romp      Gladiator II    I m getting sick of these 20 years later sequels and really had very low expectations for the movie  I don t think it s the amazing film my wife thinks that it is  but I was definitely     Entertained      Trap    I was really annoyed by the trailers for this movie  which seemingly gives away  the big reveal  and ruins the entire thing   Except they pull back that curtain very early in the movie  and it s a non issue  Really enjoyed this way more than I expected to      The Fall Guy    This is one of those movies I went into ready to be annoyed  because I had seen promos for it way too many times and was just sick of seeing that stupid trailer over and over again  I just had zero expectations going in and was pleasantly surprised  At the time of this blurb I think I ve seen it 3 times  which is unusual for me      Wicked    Coming off the heels of Mean Girls    And Dear Even Hanson    And pretty much all modern Broadway movies  I had almost no expectations at all for this one  I love Broadway  and was ready to nap my way through it     Though Wicked definitely proved me wrong  that you can do a musical correctly      The Iron Claw    If you told me I d ever feel bad for a jacked up Zac Efron I would have laughed at you  and yet here we are  The only thing that stops this from being a top contender for me is that technically it came out last year  though I saw it after that list      Alien  Romulus    I know I ll be crucified for saying this  but I ve never seen a full Alien movie all the way through  It just wasn t ever my thing  though we both really enjoyed it  I have since wanted to make my way through a chronological of the entire series  though have found myself lacking time to get around to it      I Saw The TV Glow    This is a movie that I didn t expect very much from  other than having a weird nostalgia feel to it  I really enjoyed most of it  but as it started to get really trippy towards the end it lost me      Twisters    On the list of movies that I ever thought would get a sequel this far down the road  I mean Twister seems like an easy enough candidate with a very generic premise  but I never really imagined it would happen     And yet it works     It works because it s no more a sequel of Twister than any generic disaster movie is   not   a sequel to another generic disaster movie of the same disaster      Does that even make sense  I don t know  but it was fun     Enjoyed it  but Probably Wouldn t Watch Again      Here    The movie is just different  unlike anything I ve ever seen before  I don t know if the gimmick is worth a second viewing  but it captivated me on the first one      Red One    Generic holiday action romp  we ve been getting a bunch of these in the last few years  Glad I saw it  don t regret the time spent     Might get 2 3 minutes of my time if I m ever flipping through channels and it happens to be on      A Real Pain    If I wasn t limiting myself to 3 movies in  Favorites of the Year   this would probably be number 4    Though The ambiguity of the ending feels pointless   there really isn t much to think about in that regard         Arthur the King    This is probably the first movie that has ever made me legitimately cry  I walked out of the theater nearly bawling  I give it props for that  but I have no desire to subject myself to it again      American Fiction    I d say the first 2 acts of the movie are almost perfect  but I really didn t care for the way they did the ending in multiple paths  Like    I got it from an author perspective  but I just don t feel like it worked      Challengers    I think my wife has probably seen this 5 times since it came out  I don t know if I can watch it again  Its a slower moving film  which isn t really my thing   I enjoyed it  I liked it a lot actually  but I don t think I ll be returning to the couch to see it again      Babes    It s funny in the same way all of those comedies about a very specific situation being dramatized for comedy are funny  The movie works because its a premise that I haven t seen before  But I don t think the magic will work a second time      Dune  Part Two    Look  both Dune movies are very good    And yea I ve read the source material  but they re also very long and slow  I m glad I saw it  but I don t need to watch it again      The Bikeriders    I ll be honest   I write these things at the end of the year  because I want to focus on the feelings of my experience  and not really the plot itself     And while I remember enjoying it  I also remember thinking it was very long  but other than that I couldn t give you much else      Blink Twice    Blink Twice covers some rough themes that people don t typically want to think about  but the movie works as a crazy drug induced thriller  There s a decent revenge payoff  and I go home happy      Bob Marley  One Love    No idea how accurate the movie is  but it s a fun ride      Sonic The Hedgehog 3    It s cute  just like the first 2  The story is pretty basic but I appreciate it s the type of movie that is made for kids  but the writers didn t forget that Sonic is a 90s icon  and that its older fans would be watching it too     The Mediocre Movie I Expected it to be      Beetlejuice Beetlejuice    It hits a lot of the notes you need a sequel like this to hit  but I also felt like everything was reductive and surface level  We went with the in laws  who loved it  but I didn t think it was that great      Venom  The Last Dance    Just like Venom 1 and 2 it has its moments   I m not sure if 2 or 3 is the weaker movie  and I almost certainly will never watch it again  but I don t regret the time    Or the laughs      It Ends with Us    I might be biased because my wife dragged me to this on the same weekend I dragged her to Borderlands  which maybe artificially props up my feelings of it   But I didn t totally hate it       A Quiet Place  Day One    Is Day One necessary  Probably not  But I think it s definitely a better entry into this mythos than the sequel was      Monkey Man    Indian John Wick     It s decent  but nothing I haven t seen before      Longlegs    The movie isn t scary  and it s not really much of a thriller  but it certainly is creepy and Nicholas Cage has always played the weirdo card really well     Or that s just who he is      Abigail    It s just fun   There s nothing special about it   The reveal in the end isn t anything interesting  hell the ending itself is confusing with all the back and forth  But there are vampire ballerina kids  and that s just the kind of silliness we need sometimes     Expected More and Left Disappointed      MaXXXine    Two years ago X was one of my top movies of the year  And even Pearl with all of its Wizard of Oz whimsy felt like a pretty strong movie  It s not that MaXXXine is a bad movie  I just expected more than a semi generic horror thriller  It felt as though the movie itself was written to be its own thing and the X mythos was just tacked onto it before shooting      IF    I don t really know what I was expecting with this one     But I always sort of hoped it would be some kind of Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends x Ryan Reynolds movie  It sort of just felt like too much was going on  and not enough was going on    All at the same time      Ghostbusters  Frozen Empire    Afterlife may have been really reductive of previous Ghostbusters movies  but it was enjoyable and fun  Frozen Empire was just flat the entire time and at 2h4m it felt about 45 minutes longer than necessary      The Book of Clarence    I can t quite tell if this movie just wasn t for my particular audience  or if it just wasn t very good  But it felt very long and confusing the entire way through      Imaginary    Generic gimmick horror movie is generic gimmick horror movie  Nothing special  move along      The Watchers    I don t know why I expected more  that s stupid of me  I don t actually hate The Watchers  but I do think the whole ending is kind of stupid      Y2K    I wasn t expecting a masterpiece with this one  but I thought it would be a fun nostalgia trip  I do think the first 20 30 minutes are super solid  but once we start getting into the  AI takes over the world  problem the whole thing sort of just falls apart  and none of the payoff feels earned      Moana 2    The original is a true favorite of mine  but this one feels like it s exclusively for the kids  And that s totally fine  just wasn t for me     Didn t Expect Much  and Got What I Expected      The Crow    I ve actually never seen the original The Crow   I know   but I typically don t expect much from remakes reimaginings anyway  There were parts that I  didn t hate  but overall it fell flat for me      Mean Girls    Mean Girls  the Broadway Show  is really good  This entire movie felt flat with a lot of the songs pushed into more monotone registers to makeup for hiring talent that didn t have very high vocal range    Other than Renee Rapp  I also felt like a lot of the nods to the original movie were done in an  ok fine we have to  way  instead of honoring the source material      The Front Room    I didn t expect much    Actually I don t know what I was expecting     Certainly it wasn t a seemingly ancient woman shitting herself constantly  It felt like The Front Room kept building to something that never paid off      Immaculate    Sydney Sweeny starring in  i m hot  oh but also I m a nun that fucked up   The movie has no substance to it and I was grateful when it was over  The only thing saving it from Worst of the Year is just how bad some of those movies are     Worst of the Year      Night Swim    I liked the premise of this one and really wanted to like it  but it just felt like it was missing pretty much everything a good horror movie needs      Madame Web    This movie doesn t deserve my thoughts or punctuation     Borderlands    I didn t expect Borderlands to be a good movie at all   It s one of my favorite game franchises and I had no hope that Hollywood wouldn t screw it up  but I was at least hoping for something that made sense and might hit the  so bad it s good  point  The movie is just bad  and oddly the one casting choice everyone thought made no sense   Kevin Hart   is the one casting choice that I felt actually worked      Argylle    This may be the worst movie I ve ever seen  and I used to make a point to watch some of the worst movies   as reviewed on IMDB   as a fun group activity with friends  At no point in its incoherent rambling did Argylle make any sense  and I wish it would be erased from my brain     Note    At roughly  23 m for the AMC subscription that means I spent about  5 ticket to see each movie  My wife sometimes do buy concessions   sometimes with points  sometimes without    maybe next year I ll track that too  just to see how expensive a hobby this actually is     Movies we will probably see in the next week       Mufasa   A

1eftq7xlfnvbdn,1eftq7x,lfnvbdn,qumrun60,2024-07-30 15:31:09 UTC,,,  The Crimson Pirate    1952  Directed by Robert Siodmak  and starring Burt Lancaster  Nick Cravat  and Eva Bartok   This exhuberantly silly pirate movie is filmed in a totally fictional world  with no real countries or places named in the script  but one which is at the same time naturalistic  Pirate Captain Vallo  Lancaster   who favors the color red  leads a crew of mostly good natured pirates  As the film opens  a smiling Vallo addresses the audience  telling them not to ask questions  and only to believe what you see  He then corrects that to maybe half of what you see   The plot begins with the capture by stealth of the king s ship carrying Baron Gruda on a mission to Cobra Island  When Vallo learns the details of his mission  he concocts a complex scheme to extract a triple ransom from the government for the Baron  a rebel on the island named El Libre whom Gruda is to deal with  and a shipment of arms  Needless to say  things don t go as planned  requiring the creation several more improvised schemes  a mutiny among his crew  and a romance between Vallo and El Libre s beautiful daughter Consuelo  Bartok    At the center of the action  Vallo and his mute sidekick Ojo  Cravat   perform synchronized acrobatic stunts  choreographed fights full of cartoon violence  and the use of several surprising inventions  thanks to the clever professor imprisoned with El Libre  A young Christopher Lee has a small supporting role as one of the wicked aristos  and Torin Thatcher revels in the role of Humble Bellows  the leader of Captain Vallo s  mostly  loyal opposition to his various schemes  It s good fun ,WITBFYWLW,Wicked,0.8107092976570129

6e4ef17a901777c7190d7c99319350a23894bbf8  Thanks to the excellent performance last week  this was a fantastic post Thanksgiving weekend at the box office     Moana 2    broke the record for highest post Thanksgiving weekend at the box office  while    Wicked    and    Gladiator II    continued their run  As is typical with the weekend  studios avoid releasing big stuff  The biggest push was A24 s    Y2K     which delivered one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 2 000 theaters  In contrast  the IMAX re release of    Interstellar    fared much better in just 165 theaters   The Top 10 earned a combined  128 1 million this weekend  That s up a colossal 115  from last year  when    The Boy and the Heron    opened in North America  It s the best post Thanksgiving weekend in history   Without any competition     Moana 2    easily held the top spot with  51 2 million this weekend  That represents a 63  drop  which is a little steeper than usual for the post Thanksgiving weekend  It s worse than    Wish     61       Frozen II     59       Strange World     58       Ralph Breaks the Internet     54       Frozen     53       Encanto     52    and the original    Moana     50     Through 12 days  the film has earned  299 3 million domestically  already eclipsing the original    Moana     For a comparison  it had a huge start over    Inside Out 2     but it s now running almost  60 million behind that through the same point  It should hit  500 million for the holidays  but the  600 million dream appears to be dead      Wicked    stayed at  2  dropping 55  and adding  36 4 million this weekend  That takes its domestic total to a fantastic  322 1 million  and it should finish with over  450 million      Gladiator II    dropped a rough 59   adding  12 5 million this weekend  The film has earned  132 8 million so far  and it s gonna close with a little over  150 million unless the holidays surprise us   Amazon MGM s    Red One    dropped 45   adding  7 million this weekend  That took its domestic total to  85 7 million  We d like to say it will hit  100 million  but that s pretty much Joever  Amazon announced just today that the film will start streaming on Prime Video this Thursday  That s gonna kill legs   The Indian film    Pushpa 2  The Rule    opened with  4 88 million in 1 245 theaters  which grows to  9 3 million in its first five days   Paramount re released Christopher Nolan s    Interstellar    in 165 IMAX theaters  It earned a huge  4 6 million in these locations  which translates to a  27K per theater average  IMAX reported that the 10 screenings that ran the film on 70mm sold out  These numbers took its lifetime gross to  192 6 million   Sony Crunchyroll s    Solo Leveling  ReAwakening    earned  2 4 million from just  846 theaters  Not bad for a recap of the first season   Fathom Events released the concert film    For King   Country s A Drummer Boy Christmas Live    in 1 540 theaters  for a limited 4 day run  It finished in eighth place with  2 2 million   2 8 million four day    Debuting in ninth place  we find A24 s    Y2K     which flopped with just  2 1 million in 2 108 theaters  That s a poor  1 003 per theater average  suggesting a lot of empty screenings  It is the 33rd worst debut for a film in over 2 000 theaters    This shouldn t be a big surprise to anyone  The film lacked big names  with the big emphasis on its writer and director  Kyle Mooney  Mooney is definitely well known for    Saturday Night Live     but like a lot of stars in the show  that doesn t mean people will flock to watch that star on the screen  Horror is a profitable genre  but the film is actually a horror comedy  making it a tougher sell  A24 takes a lot of risks  but it was clear that this would struggle  Since its SXSW premiere  reviews have been mixed  and they ve been worsening  currently at 43  on RT   making it one of the worst titles of the studio  It s simply a film that couldn t find an audience   According to A24  58  of the audience was male  and 77  was in the 18 34 demographic  They gave it an awful  C   on CinemaScore  suggesting the film will fade quickly from theaters  A run under  5 million is a possibility  and the film could be gone from theaters by the time New Year arrives  Not the best years for Rachel Zegler  apparently   Rounding up the Top 10 was Lionsgate s    The Best Christmas Pageant Ever     It fell 53   adding  1 5 million this weekend and taking its total to  34 4 million   Outside the Top 10  we find    Werewolves     a horror action title with Frank Grillo  It hit 1 351 theaters  but it flopped with just  1 million this weekend  Don t expect it to last long   Vertical also decided to release Justin Kurzel s    The Order    in 603 theaters  but it only made  878 000 this weekend  Ouch   A24 expanded Luca Guadagnino s    Queer    to 47 theaters  It added  405 910 this weekend  taking its run to  866K after 10 days  It will continue expanding   Searchlight didn t even bother with    Nightbitch     Not only did they dump it in 82 theaters  but they didn t release box office numbers  Le sigh      OVERSEAS       Moana 2    continued leading the box office after its record breaking weekend  It added  103 7 million overseas  taking its worldwide numbers to  599 million  Its biggest debut was Japan  where it opened with  6 5 million  The best markets so far are France   32 5M   UK   27 2M   Germany   19 7M   Mexico   19 1M  and Brazil   16M   A billion is imminent  but it looks like it will take a little while   While    Wicked    registering strong numbers domestically  it continues performing softly overseas  This weekend  it added  26 9 million  taking its worldwide total to  457 5 million  It had very soft debuts in France   2M   Netherlands   1 9M  and Poland   900K   The best markets are the UK   47 4M   Australia   17 2M   South Korea   10 6M   Mexico   8 1M  and Spain   4 5M   It will open in more markets  but it s not like it will suddenly explode  If it was performing on par with its domestic run  we d say a billion is a possibility  but that s not the case here  70  of its money is coming from the domestic market  which is crazy      Gladiator II    added  17 million this weekend  taking its worldwide total to  368 5 million  The film is slowing down  and while it will hit  400 million  it won t get much further than that  Far below the original s  460 million worldwide total      The Lord of the Rings  The War of the Rohirrim    opened in 31 markets  mostly Latin America  a week ahead of its worldwide rollout  To say that it performed badly would be an understatement  The film debuted with an awful  2 million  It had terrible starts in Spain   347K   Mexico   239K   Thailand   146K   Brazil   106K   and Czech Republic   103K   Yep  not a single market over  1 million  This suggests the film is heading for very ugly numbers in the rest of the world      FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN

 Sony    4 875 195    12 227 851    13 295 076    50M    Wake up babe  new Zemeckis flop just dropped  After barely one month in theaters  Sony Miramax s    Here    has closed with just  12 million domestically and  13 million worldwide  Despite touting the film as a    Forrest Gump    reunion  Zemeckis  Roth  Hanks and Wright   the audience was uninterested  In fact  the domestic total is barely half of what    Forrest Gump    earned on its opening weekend back in 1994  and that s not even adjusted  Oh  Robert Zemeckis  what happened to you  To say that his glory days have passed        THIS WEEKEND    Five films  two of which are hitting wide release  But none stand a chance in topping the box office   The first is Sony s latest addition in the Spider Manless Spider Man Universe     Kraven the Hunter     This universe has been mostly profitable  but it carries an asterisk  The three    Venom    films are hits  while the other two     Morbius    and    Madame Web     flopped and became Internet s laughingstock     Kraven    is leaning towards the latter  And for reasons beyond understand  Sony decided that this film warranted  130 million  making it their most expensive SSU film  After this  who knows what ll happen   The other wide release is Warner Bros  s    The Lord of the Rings  The War of the Rohirrim     an anime prequel to Peter Jackson s trilogy  This franchise is one of the most powerful in film history    yet    The War of the Rohirrim    is not gonna come close anywhere close to that  Anime has a ceilling at the box office  and the pre sales are insanely low  With a low screen count  limited marketing  and middling reviews so far  we ll see how low it can go   Paramount is releasing    September 5    in limited release  before its wide release on January 17  The film recounts the 1972 Munich Olympic hostage crisis from the perspective of the ABC Sports crew and their coverage of the events  The film has received some solid reviews so far   Amazon MGM is releasing    Nickel Boys    in limited release  The story follows two African American boys  Elwood and Turner  who are sent to an abusive reform school called the Nickel Academy in 1960s Florida  The film has received critical acclaim  and there s Oscar buzz on the horizon  Watch out for this one   The other one is Gia Coppola s    The Last Showgirl     starring Pamela Anderson  Reviews are very positive  with Anderson lauded for a career best performance                                                                                                 If you re interested in

1bg3xdakv5f2rs,1bg3xda,kv5f2rs,VectorJones,2024-03-16 15:34:34 UTC,,,  SPOILERS    Granted  there is an overarching feminist tone to the movie  It s up to the viewer to decide if that s admirable or not  Once identified  it s impossible to ignore how much the feminist perspective sets the tone for this movie  both in positive and maybe not so positive ways  I came to admire the portrayal of Bella s development into an adult  free from conformity to most any limitations be they social  political  or sexual  She is able to realize herself on her own terms  On the other hand  I wasn t thrilled with how much of the film s antagonistic elements are represented by male characters  which feels needlessly heavy handed and divisive at times    Examples of this later point are obvious throughout the movie  although I give the film credit for offering some of these male characters a redemptive arc  Take  God   a man with seemingly no feeling who initially sees Bella and her mother as little more than pieces of meat to be played with under his scalpel  yet in the end comes to show Bella about as much love and affection as a life long abuse victim can  There s also Max  a weakling cuckold yielding to any stronger personality that might establish dominance over him  who nonetheless manages to remain loyal to Bella  perhaps beyond his own best interests and despite the fact that she has very little respect for him    The two clear antagonists of the movie  Duncan and Alfie  never really have redemptive arcs and are riddled with negative characteristics  Duncan is a lecherous manipulator who winds up pathetically neutered and defenseless  Alfie is never anything more than a psychopath whose cruelty drives his staff to rebellion  his wife to suicide   So there s not a whole lot to admire in most of this film s male characters  however  I give the film more credit for being mindful enough not to lower itself into a portrayal of all men as wicked and all women as saints  Some of the female characters are rather dubious as well  Mrs  Prim is pretty much a co conspirator to Bella s abuse and also to Felicity s  offering contempt for Bella s willfulness and affinity for Felicity s helplessness  Swiney is a practiced manipulator  extolling the virtues of a pragmatism and responsibility to beguile Bella into the dynamic of most any madam or pimp  where a semblance of parental care acts as a guise for abuse   Then there is Bella herself  who as you mentioned is seemingly unable to feel or express love and affection for those closest to her  Her only meaningful expression of feeling for others is when she sees the homeless people suffering anonymously from afar  I think the film uses this moment as a kind of foreshadowing or unconscious realization  whereby Bella s origins and the true extent of her mistreatment are teased to the viewer   By the end of the film  I came to see Bella s seemingly muted emotional qualities as a consequence of her unusual upbringing and development  God and Mrs  Prim weren t exactly fostering an emotionally balanced environment  Bella s often abusive relationships out in the world didn t extol the benefits of emotional connection either  With all she endures in the film  I can t blame her at all for coming to feel like people need to be kept at arm s length ,Discussion,Wicked,0.7014439105987549

1h7cld4m0k71zv,1h7cld4,m0k71zv,nearcatch,2024-12-05 16:37:02 UTC,,,Really  The Grande Mescal one looks like the worst episode on this list  I don t think either of them has a body of work large enough to give them the insights and experience needed to make an interesting conversation to watch  Grande s only major role is Wicked  Mescal was in Aftersun  but that and Gladiator II are the only major roles he s had  Having them on Actors on Actors is flattering both of them     Edit    recently watching Gladiator II made me be unfair to Mescal  as commenters have pointed out  But I stand by Grande not having much to contribute  even if Wicked is taking off  She was in music videos and Disney channel stuff prior to this    There s no way I would rank a conversation with her about acting above most of the other actors on the list  Jolie Erivo  Domingo Culkin  Moore Adams  Winslet Salda a  Swinton Brody   The only person she maybe beats out is Pamela Anderson  but even then  Anderson  also  has a recent critically lauded role ,News,Wicked,0.7866525650024414

1hftsx6m2ed4at,1hftsx6,m2ed4at,whatuseisausername,2024-12-16 22:05:53 UTC,,,Most the movie studios being hesitant to have part 2 in the title is getting annoying at this point  They want as many people as possible to see the movie  and having part 2 in the title makes it clear that they will have to watch the first movie first  I get that will cause some people to wait to see it  but at the same time they also need to watch the first movie anyways for the second one to make any sense    It s just dishonest at this point imo to not make it clear that a movie is only half the story  For example  I went to see Wicked with my mother recently  and she had no idea that it was actually part 1 of the story until I told her before we went to see it  In the past she was at least mildly upset when we go see a movie that is actually a  part one  of a two part movie series  but she was unaware of that beforehand  After going to to see Avengers  Infinity War she was really pissed off walking out of the theater   However  after watching Wicked she still enjoyed it  and it didn t bother her at all that we had to wait a year for part 2 ,News,Wicked,0.6515794396400452

1gwxxy1lyi45xj,1gwxxy1,lyi45xj,ladykathleen13,2024-11-23 00:18:57 UTC,,,I m a long time fan of  Wicked  and have seen it on stage multiple times  I ve been keeping my hopes in check for this adaptation  but on the whole I really liked it  I still don t love the choice to bisect the story  but Elphaba s act one character arc translates here as sturdy enough for a standalone  There s nothing anticlimactic about  Defying Gravity    Fantastic work by the chorus  orchestra  dancers  and design teams  especially the costumers  for the delightful energy they brought to the film   One Short Day  was a particular thrill  Some of the chorus sequences were  tonally  handled with interesting deviations from the play     No One Mourns the Wicked  comes to mind  The ensemble on stage  in their choreography and costuming  comes across menacing and mob like  this is reflected in the music s dissonances and moments of brutality  In the film  the props department carried that energy into the propaganda banners  the effigy  etc   and the celebrating crowd s engagement with that still emerges as disturbing  but on the balance  they still read gentler  more family friendly  The way the public is characterized in  Wicked  is important  and so far  the adaptation s perspective scans as a touch less cynical  I don t yet know how I feel about the change either way    For me  Cynthia was absolutely the stand out performer  Her Elphaba was a bit softer and more solemn than I have sometimes seen her played on stage  but her performance felt rounded  consistent  and complete  and she sang the role beautifully  I was moved to tears during both  The Wizard and I  and  Defying Gravity   and I absolutely bought the depth of her disappointment and resolve following the Grimmerie action   Each time I ve seen the stage version  Glinda has been my favorite character  and so I had a really high bar for her depiction  I know the script quite well  and most of her funniest moments from the stage were duplicated here  Admittedly  it s harder to earn laughs for a joke that the viewer already knows by heart  but every stage Glinda has pulled it off  Unfortunately  Ariana didn t quite get there for me  Her performance was fine  but in both acting and singing  she was missing some of the warmth and nuance that have given the character life on stage  A lot of laugh lines fell flat at my showing  and  Popular  was one of the few disappointments of the movie for me  although I don t think that s wholly her fault  The song is always bouncy and bubbly on stage  but the scene setting is simple  the delivery entirely rests on Galinda s charisma  The maximalism of the cinematography choreography design during this song in the film was vibrant and fun but distracted too heavily from the thesis statement she s delivering  lyrically  and cut back on opportunities for characterization   I guess it just surprises me to see so many comments calling Ariana s performance the more memorable or compelling of the two central characters  and I would be curious to know how much of the buzz comes from viewers who are already familiar with this character versus those who aren t  It might be an even split  I could be in the minority for having Ariana s Galinda resonate less with me than every Galinda I ve seen on stage  Of course  I ve also seen very captivating performances from stage Elphabas  but Cynthia measured up to them much better  for me  I found her fully enchanting ,Official Discussion,Wicked,0.9110499620437622

1fl1beulnzm82k,1fl1beu,lnzm82k,LiteraryBoner,2024-09-20 02:07:21 UTC,,,Two things that really surprised me while watching this  The first was that Steve Buscemi voices Starscream  The second was that the Transformers do a 9 11 in a September released kid s action movie  I m not really sure how else to define the scene where they hijack a skytrain and drive it right through a notable government building    I have my complaints about this movie  but overall it was a good and fun time and it s so nice to see them get the action right  I m no huge transformerhead but I used to watch Beast Wars every morning before school and every time I see one of the live action movies I feel like they put so much CGI and work into such busy and bland action  This feels kind of like Mutant Mayhem where they re sticking with a distinct style that lets them have the fun set pieces while putting focus on vocal performances    My complaints are mostly character based  I really enjoyed these performances and I liked the mixture of bouncy fun and heavy themes of propaganda and class  but it really felt like D 16 s turn towards evil happened very quickly  I understand his illusion was shattered  but there s really no anger or resentment in him at all in the beginning and it just feels like at some point his entire personality turns on a heel    Friends to enemies is so in right now  honestly this is basically Wicked on Cybertron  But Wicked is interesting because it sympathizes with the evil friend the most  whereas this keeps Optimus as the main character and at some point just kind of casts off D 16 as an evil radical  The story itself is interesting  but I just didn t think they balanced the differing ideologies as well as they could have  Ideally I d like to see both points of view but this movie kind of damns the decepticons intentions    But that feels like a nitpick next to this visual feast of a movie  Some really thrilling action sequences  some solid comedy  and despite my complaints it s a more interesting story than a movie like this would usually attempt  Compare it to Super Mario Bros and it comes off looking like Lawrence of Arabia  It s a solid 7 10 for me    r reviewsbyboner,Official Discussion,Wicked,0.5550824999809265

1gwxxy1lyctdny,1gwxxy1,lyctdny,LiteraryBoner,2024-11-22 03:01:02 UTC,,,Pretty amazing that they built the coolest library set of all time just to repeatedly disrespect every book in it for Dancing Through Life lmao   To be honest I was worried about how this one would turn out  I have a pretty strong connection to Wicked  I was in high school and a deep theater band nerd in  03 when this show premiered on Broadway  It was basically a canon event  absolutely cataclysmic how instantly it spread  I listened to the album every day for years  I ve seen it live  and after all these years Defying Gravity still gets to me  All the pieces seemed to be in place for this movie  Chu is a fantastic visual director and really proved himself worthy with In the Heights and it felt like they waited this long because they knew how big of an entity they were dealing with and didn t want to rush it    But even after reviews came out I held my breath  and it was the coolest thing  in the opening number No One Mourns the Wicked when they get to the second chorus and everyone in town threw flower petals in the air it was just such a wonderful audio visual moment I kind of let that breath out knowing I was in good hands  I saw it twice in a row  last night and earlier today  and honestly I couldn t be happier with the outcome  This movie is a real joy to experience  and it s not lost on me how difficult this must have been to pull off  The stage show has incredible music but the story mechanics are very much made for the stage  but for the screenplay they really dig into some things and flesh them out much better  The final act working like it does is it s own piece of magic  For as silly a time as we ve had  you can really feel the weight of why these characters have to go this path and their strong bond that makes them understand the other s decision  They also set up the Fiyera Glinda Elphaba triangle way better than I expected them to  That s gonna pay out big next year   I m too old to have any opinion at all on Ariana Grande  but she honestly devours this role so hard  Apparently she hounded the producers for years to keep her at the top of the list while they put this together and you can really tell  Of all the things that feel very right in this she absolutely nails the endearing aloofness of Glinda  She gets the physical comedy and successfully brings the campiness of stage broadway to the big screen  which is a really tough task  and she really makes such an airheaded character feel full  There s a great moment right as she s about to light up the Wicked Witch effigy in the opener where she really takes a moment to consider the part she s playing in all this  A surprisingly nuanced and hilarious performance from her    Unsurprisingly  Erivo is wonderful too  I know people take issue with her offstage but you really can t deny her talent on  She convincingly goes from prickly to soft  plays the outcast well  and is up for the challenge because a lot of her scenes are tough to pull off  I was totally enamored by the Dancing Through Life Ozdust Ballroom scene  Fiyero kills it and it s just this 25 minute run of movie that is all song and dance and plot movement  The entire emotional arc of this movie rests on that moment where Elphaba and Glinda come to understand each other and it s a purposefully awkward scene  but both times I saw this movie I was astounded by how well they pulled it off and how emotional that awkward dance got me  The first time Erivo s voice is really let free is in The Wizard and I scene and you can feel her happiness and hopefulness bursting off the screen  I would not at all be surprised if both leads get nominations for this    I have also never seen a Production Design and Costumes award so securely in the bag  This is a movie that really jumps at you  people complain about the length but the way it keeps your eyes interested makes it feel like a breeze  Not just the dance numbers and the sets  but the way they move and the lush plants and animals in every shot  Wizard of Oz obviously has a strong relationship to cinematic color and history in general and this movie understands that  Shiz has a bright  whimsical feel to it and Bowen Yang is the perfect person to cut to for a reaction shot in this world  Not to mention Emerald City looks insane  the train that brought them there alone was the coolest thing I d seen in a while  The Idina Menzel Kristin Chenoweth cameo was really well done and is there a better feeling for a broadway nerd than when Idina straightens Cynthia s hat and gives her that approving smile  What a nice moment  and then I died when Idina did the famous Defying Gravity runner   Michelle Yeoh looked amazing  I kind of wish she had taken a page out of Goldblum s book and just improvised half her lines  Wizard and I is such a wonderful number but I could feel her trying to keep up with the spoken word parts of that song whereas Goldblum spends his third act just making the dialogue and the character totally his own  It works really well  too  someone that weird and eccentric just feels right at home in Oz  I m excited to see him do Wonderful in the next movie  such a left field but also perfect choice for the Wizard  I love that the first time you see him in this movie is his giant face carved into a stone cave wall  bit of a Goldblum jumpscare there    Hard for me to stress how much this feels like best case scenario for a project this massive  I m a big fan of musicals and IMO they have been a bit on the outs in the last decade  It felt like the public turned on them around Les Mis and CATS just sealed the deal  We still get great musicals like In the Heights  Westside Story  even Wonka was solid as a rock  but they aren t the critical and awards and general public darlings they used to be  It s cool to see one that has the potential to be really mainstream and do a legitimate awards run  Fans will love it and I think everyone else will be charmed by the legitimate fun and whimsy in store  It s an easy 9 10 for me and will likely be a movie I see many more times in the near future    r reviewsbyboner,Official

aware that this data is dumb 3   Green Room  and  The Blackcoat s Daughter  are my favorite A24 horror films   The idea for this dumb data article came to me while watching  The Shining   1980   As Jack and his family are driving through Colorado  average altitude of 6 800 feet  I started thinking about movies like  Devil  The Devil s Pass  Evil Dead Rise   and  Blood Red Sky     movies that take place in skyscrapers  airplanes or a high altitude location  Basically  movies that take place in an elevated location  The idea made me laugh because of the recent debate about  Elevated Horror   a divisive term that describes horror movies that avoid jump scares gore blood explosions and instead rely on allegories or emotionally complex stories that psychologically affect viewers  In other words   Jason X   which is beautiful  is not an Elevated Horror film   despite it taking place in space   The one company that kept coming up while researching elevated horror was A24  the beautiful movie production company  I m a proud AAA24 member  that has been distributing excellent films since 2013  Because of all the press coverage that made A24 the face of elevated horror  I decided to see which A24 horror film is the most elevated   by altitude  Yes  it s a dumb idea  but it makes me laugh and I learned a lot about being above sea level     Here s a list of the movies that will be

Monster  was filmed in Ottawa but it seems to take place in Any Town USA  I scoured the film for a location  but I couldn t find where it takes place  The license plates are never seen and nobody is like  We re stuck in Hudson  Florida   Because of this  I placed it in Ottawa     It Comes at Night  was filmed in upstate New York  and the location is left vague  the license plates are no help   Because of this I placed it in New York     Tusk  was filmed in North Carolina  but it takes place in Manitoba  Thus  I counted the setting and not the filming location  Same for  Midsommar     I left out  High Life  because it takes place in space  Too easy    When it comes to elevated horror  movies like  Get Out  The Babadook  It Follows   and  Black Swan  were also mentioned numerous times  However  they take place in low ish altitudes so I left them out to make sure this dumb data article didn t spiral out of control    I pulled the maps from  here  https   www reddit com r australia

is that the most elevated films are  Hereditary    1  and  Midsommar    2   Ari Aster directed both of them and they are also the two highest grossing A24 horror films  It s pretty great that the highest grossing A24 horror films are also the most elevated   Hereditary  takes place in Park City  Utah  which has an elevation of 7 000 feet  Ari Aster s film about a very patient cult who want to snag some hell money  also features a character being elevated into a treehouse and there s a spooky scene that takes place in an attic  The film is also heavy thematically on grief  depression  and family trauma which fit in nicely with the elevated horror folks  It also features a head getting obliterated  Highest part of the body   which should sit nicely for the people who like horror films that feature head obliteration     Fun Data      Elevation Facts        0 250 Feet      81 1 Tomatometer average and a  7 4 million average at the worldwide box office     250   500 Feet      71 8

 The Lighthouse  X  Pearl   and  Saint Maud  helped this category a lot     Honorable Mentions       Lamb   2021  takes place in Akureyri Iceland  56m   184 feet  and filmed in a valley about an hour away from the town center   Lamb  gets extra points for having the main characters  home be placed in a valley that is surrounded by mountains and occasionally we see the characters hiking in the hills and climbing up steep inclines  So  while it doesn t have the highest altitude it does feature loads of high places  An added bonus is that the bedrooms are on the second floor     Bodies Bodies Bodies   2022  features some solid mountain shots as the core duo drive to the mansion  However  the mansion where they shot is only somewhere around 330 height in elevation     Into the Fores t  2015  takes place somewhere in the pacific northwest  It doesn t give me a lot to work with  so I referenced the book in which the setting is in Northern California  The movie was filmed in Canada     A Ghost Story   2017  features some solid skyscraper work    The Lighthouse   2017  features a 70 foot lighthouse that was built for the movie    Life After Beth  features some solid mountain hiking

and am just some university student that loves the Kung Fu Panda series  I ve never been the one to willingly post on Reddit other than to ask questions about miscellaneous subjects   alas I am here writing a full blown essay out of frustration  However  I hate writing essays and I don t want to spent eons formatting my unhinged rant in a coherent way  so I ll be using subtitles for everyone s convenience   My original idea was to write big post nitpicking every aspect of the movie  but I got midterms coming up and I got priorities  So today  I ll leave it at criticism of only the characters and maybe I ll come back one day to make a Part 2 about the theme  comedy  or something else      x200B     x200B     Characters    Starting off with the newly introduced characters   It s BAD    There were a good number of new faces that we ve never seen before  but the only once of significance are Zhen and Chameleon  because the others don t have ANY character and could have been written without their presence  The biggest offender is the group of underground criminals  Sure they were not completed void of details with the armadillo  small bunnies  and monkeys    but were they really necessary  I understand that they were introduced to be utilized later in the battle  but we only got maybe a minute worth of screentime of them actually in action  What was the point in them existing  What s the connection between Zhen and the armadillo  Why are they mad at Zhen  So many question are left unanswered and I see so much more could have been done to flesh out these characters and atmosphere  but nothing is done  All the characters are basically just there as plot devices and decorations  No relationships and character dynamics are explored leaving things to feel hollow and rushed  Don t even get me STARTED on the group of gang leaders  introduced alongside Chameleon     Chameleon     On that note  the sentiment of hollow  unpolished character carries over to the main antagonist Chameleon  who makes me want to grab the movie producers  shoulders and scream  WHYYyyy   I see so much potential in this villain that was not fully explored  We have seen different fighting styles from the villains so far in the series  starting with kung fu  Tai Lung   gunpowder  Shen   then spirits  Kai   which would have been well rounded out by magic  Chameleon  if it was executed well  The audience was directly told that she was a sorcerer  but was not shown any magic other than when Chameleon transforms or steals kung fu from the masters  which was not explained in ANY capacity  In fact  almost nothing is explained of her magical prowess  So many questions spring to mind like  Where did she learn it  How does the magic system work  How can kung fu be taken away from people  WTF ARE THE CAGES MADE AND WHY DOES CHAMELEON JUST BRUSH IT OFF WITH  It S sOmE oLd MaGiC  OR WHATEVER NONESENSE      In essence  I think that the villain lacks a true backstory and suffers from not having their own unique identity other than spooky shapeshifting lizard that falls into basic villain tropes  However  the biggest flaw of this character in my opinion is its lack of presence throughout the film and the suspense that comes with it  Again comparing with the other KP movies  get used to it   KP4 doesn t fully utilize the villain as it introduces Chameleon at the beginning  shelves her during the middle act  then grabs her off the shelf for the grand finale fight  Unlike Tai Lung who was slowly approaching the town with impending doom  Shen controlling everything within his reach  and Kai gathering the characters that we have grown to love  Chameleon does not provide any of that suspense and is not integrated into the story  In the other KP movies  the villains were always interwoven with the main plot and were given plenty of screentime to give them personalities and a sense of danger  but Chameleon just falls flat  She is no more than a very one dimensional character that achieves nothing but being the big bad the main character has to defeat     Zhen     I know that the character was meant to be written this way and no hate to the voice actor  love the Asian representation   but I fucking hated this character  Just the overwhelming bratty personality and the voice to complement it really did achieved what it was going for  but it left the character to be so unlikeable for me  I realize that this is only a personal gripe and many others may not share the same opinion as me  but I really needed to get it out there  Her introduction of stealing artifacts from the temple seemed so out of the blue and was not explained at all throughout the whole movie  We were basically just handed a scene with no plot relevance and were told to just deal with it  Yes  it is revealed later that Zhen works under Chameleon and her goal was to take the staff of wisdom  but no excuse or made up story was presented when Po captured Zhen which felt like an odd cinematic choice to make  And later  she just joins Po on an adventure without rhyme or reason other than the fact that she knows Chameleon  which is not suspicious at all     And holy fuck Zhen is the definition of a character archetype  From when she first took off her hood revealing her fox like features  I just knew that she d be the  cunning fox that steals   So many aspects of her character were predictable with her sly nature and pending betrayal that could be seen from miles away  I m not sure if it was the basic character tropes or just my overall dislike of her character  but I didn t even know her name by the end of the movie and had to google it just to write this post  Zhen doesn t really have ay compelling traits or lacks the attention to background and character relations that are mandatory to write a good main protagonist    An example of a good deuteragonist is Tigress in KP1  Her backstory  while simple  tells a heartfelt story of an orphan rescued by Shifu who trained her hardest to become the best warrior  but was always overshadowed by Tai Lung  Here  we are told in just a few scenes why Tigress is the hardcore warrior she is  with her ironclad emotions  and why she had such a big dislike for Po  This short flashback sequence successfully conveys the relationships Tigress has with her closest people being Shifu and Tai Lung  telling the overarching theme of neglect and shows Tigress s character development as she opens up to Po and is able to freely express her emotions again  All these aspects of Tigress allow the audience to sympathize and see her in a different light that paints the picture that she may not be an asshole that she seemed to be from her initial introduction  making her a likeable character    However  all of these factors that were mastered in previous movies are missing in KP4  which makes Zhen feel like nothing more than a one dimensional character      x200B     Conclusion    While I may seem like a merciless bitch slandering a decent Disney Production  please understand that I m doing this because I know what the KP production crew is capable of  I know that the newly introduced characters could have been written to the standards of Tai Lung  Shen  Tigress  and all the other fantastic characters if not for the rushed production and cost cuts  At the end of the day  I m just a randomass Redditor spewing nonsense online and my word should be taken with a grain of salt  Let me know your thoughts on my take          x200B     Sidenote     I m really fucking peeved that the Furious Five was not in the movie AT ALL  I missed them and their comedic dynamics   ,Discussion,Kung Fu Panda 4,0.788964033126831

18z9fnspost,18z9fns,,LundgrensFrontKick,2024-01-05 15:26:40 UTC,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18z9fns/,69.0,While working on an assignment last year I was reminded that 1993 was a massive year for Sylvester Stallone  After several years of flops   Rocky V  Oscar  Stop  Or My Mom Will Shoot    Stallone needed a hit and they came in the form of  Cliffhanger  and  Demolition Man   The critically respected action films pulled in over  400 million worldwide and gave Stallone s career a much needed boost  These movies don t have much in common  aside from being awesome   but they do feature Stallone in some very cold situations  In  Demolition Man   he s sentenced to decades inside an ice cube  and in  Cliffhanger  he battles John Lithgow atop the Rocky Mountains  This got me thinking about other Stallone movies and I started noticing a pattern  Between  Rocky  First Blood  Rocky II  Rocky IV  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol  2  and  The Expendables 2   his  Cold Stallone  films do well with critics and audiences when he s in a cold location  or frozen inside an ice prison  Also  his love of fur coats inspired  Ryan Gosling s Ken character in Barbie  https   people com greta gerwig says sylvester stallone inspired ken in barbie movie ryan gosling loves him 8384260   Good things happen when Stallone is cold      Check this out         Expendables 2      When he meets JCVD s character for the first time  it s cold outside  This is the only time in the franchise when Sly seems chilly  and it s the highest rated film in the franchise      Guardians of the Galaxy Vol  2      He s introduced on an ice planet       Creed      Super cold   Sly s highest rated movie on Rotten Tomatoes     First Blood      Super cold   Highest rated Rambo movie     Rocky IV      He goes to Russia and trains in the snow  It s the highest grossing movie in the  Rocky  franchise       Creed and Rocky      He s been nominated for three Academy Awards for his work in  Rocky  and  Creed   Very cold    I wanted to see if this assumption held up so I rewatched most of his films  I already knew he was super cold in  Cliffhanger  Rocky 4   and  Demolition Man   and lumped them into three categories  1    Not Cold or Chilly      There are no instances in which he seems chilly 2    Chilly      It s not freezing outside  but it s still cold  For instance  In  Cobra   a character says  It s getting cold out here  huh  Yeah  Better get inside    3    Cold      In  Creed II  while he s sitting by Adrian s grave he rubs his hands together and blows warm air into them  Dude is cold  He doesn t have to be cold for the entire film  he just needs to be really cold at least once     Here are some quick overall stats for Stallone s career      Average Worldwide Box Office    149 million   Average Tomatometer Score   44    Average IMDb User Score   6 06    Box Office      Cold    193 million   Chilly    93 million   Hot    130 million    Tomatometer       Cold   63    Chilly   38    Hot   35     IMDb      Cold   6 78   Chilly   5 98   Hot   5 725    Conclusion      Cold Stallone  plus a good script  direction  editing and solid supporting characters  is the best Stallone    Take a look at this timeline and you ll notice that Stallone is at his best  for the most part  when he s cold     https   preview redd it agd0776g0nac1 png width 526 format png auto webp s

list territory   1982    First Blood     Cold   Excellent action film   1985    Rocky IV     Cold   Highest grossing  Rocky  movie    1985   1993   He had some big hits  but nothing huge or critically adored   1993   Cold   Career Comeback    Demolition Man  and  Cliffhanger    1993   2006   Had a few cool films like  Copland  and  Daylight   but it wasn t great   2006   Cold    Rocky Balboa     It was smart going back to Rocky  and it was very smart to make him cold again     2006   2012   solid run  but nothing Oscar worthy or  Rocky IV  huge     2012    The Expendables 2     Chilly  not cold     312 million worldwide  Only chilly  Expendables  movie and it made bank and has a Fresh Tomatometer score     2016   Cold    Creed     Huge hit and he got an Oscar nominated    2017   Cold

194kp3akhh0gr4,194kp3a,khh0gr4,IHappenToBeJosh,2024-01-12 04:21:37 UTC,,,My overly long thoughts going song by song from a big fan of it back when it was on Broadway     A Cautionary Tale  I love that they tried but it just really didn t work on screen  I don t think much could ve saved this  but come on it did not sound like they were recording it  I don t usually care about not singing live  or being overproduced  or such unless it s egregious  but this needed more of a homemade feel to have any chance of working     What If s  It was pretty good I guess  I missed It Roars and I don t feel like this was so good or special or doing anything different enough to justify the swap  but I m mostly neutral    Meet the Plastics  RIP Where Do You Belong  such a good song  Anyway  it s not meet the plastics  it s meet Regina  done well enough  wish they kept someone actually humping her leg lol  Also missed the other verses  but I get that whatever logic made them cut where do you belong also applies to that so oh well    Stupid with Love  UGH I m so annoyed because they messed this up so much while also being SO CLOSE  First  the cuts were unnecessary  those definitely could ve been done in a fun way for the screen  But second and mainly I NEEDED THE DESK PENCIL CHOREOGRAPHY  So iconic  So good  There were maybe glimpses of it but it never fully got there and that s such a shame  Some really good parts though  in a vacuum I probably would ve said it was done pretty well Edit  Listening to the soundtrack I m remembering how much they changed the sound of it  It s all cutesy and consistent instead of interesting and mildly frantic  they ve removed all the character from Cady and all the comedy from the song itself  even if they added some comedy back visually   The cutesy  sheepish vibe just isn t it  it needed more energy   Desks  Pencils      Apex Predator  Maybe controversial opinion  but I really like this and thought the change of it worked really well  Sure  the loss of the Cady Janis song is sad  but that s forgiven since it went toward Jaquel Spivey who was absolutely robbed with these song cuts     What s Wrong with Me  Not much to say about this  Was integrated into the movie well  but the fact that that s notable says more about the other songs than about this one    Sexy  Another one I think worked really well     Someone Gets Hurt  I don t know why but it was just slightly off to me  Not that bad though Edit  Aaron really needs the  damn you re fine   Shows why he gets sucked in better after his initial reaction      Revenge Party  I love this song so much so it was hard not to love it  Not sure how I feel about the whole part my aesthetic  but pretty fun in general I guess  Will have to look at the actual old verse vs new verse but that whole change kinda took me out of it  unless that was the tour version    The montage parts were great  Was missing a lion costume with people humping inside it       cut songs break     Fearless would ve actually been so perfect  it needed it   WHY    Even though it s not near the top of what my song rankings would be  I think it s easily the worst cut  At least do Gretchen s part    Stop is a fun song but I 100  understand the cut    Whose House is This  is a song I never liked that much but I kinda found myself missing it       More is Better is a song I cared about even less than Fearless but also feels like a nonsensical cut  It would ve worked there so well    Someone Gets Hurt  Reprise   so good    World Burn  This is one that was worse than the stage show not because it was bad but because the papers flying was iconic  Still good though     I d Rather Be Me  Integrated badly but whatever  great song and it was sung and done great here     cut song  again  do a shortened version of Do This Thing instead of cutting it  if even just for like the answers part  I didn t need a stupid with love reprise here  Let Ben Wang and Fernell Hogan sing      I See Stars  It was good  I was very interested by the playing in the background during a scene part  which then made more sense of course  I love that they did that instead of cutting the rest of it though     Overall I can t say if it was any good or not because I was just having a good time reminiscing  This was the last show I saw pre COVID  Waited 4 hours for rush tickets and got front row seats to appreciate Renee Rapp  Kate Rockwell  Grey Henson  Barrett Wilbert Weed and many others  performances up close    Nostalgia     aside though  some of the transitions implementations of the songs hurt  I know a lot of people have talked about Mean Girls being not a great musical before  and the film setting just made that so much more clear  I don t know why they didn t make more little changes like with Apex Predator to fit the songs in better  Wouldn t have to be substantial changes like that  just some kind of adjustments to make it flow better  Idk,Official Discussion,Mean Girls,0.6419391632080078

1gvrno4ly4qsnm,1gvrno4,ly4qsnm,Comprehensive-Fun47,2024-11-20 17:43:31 UTC,,,Good question   I think Wicked has been in development hell for a while   Hamilton  while not a movie movie  planned to wait ten years to release it and only moved up the timeline due to the pandemic  They didn t want to cannibalize the live productions  Maybe not the best example though because Hamilton is hugely popular   Dear Evan Hansen wanted to do it sooner  but the pandemic played a part in the delays  This is the odd one that people think could have waited longer because the main actor had aged out of the role  but they used him anyway  They ignore that the movie wouldn t have gotten made with a different actor in the lead  It bombed anyway   I m trying to think of other recent examples  I think not wanting to cannibalize the live production plays a part  but the truth is the market for movie musicals is not what it used to be  They usually get made as passion projects  In the Heights only got made because the writer got famous from a later project  It was a good adaptation  but the audience for it was already small   General audiences just don t like musicals  But I m glad they keep getting made  because it s an art form all its own  Movie musicals allow the musical to reach a wider audience   Ideally I d like more proshots of stage musicals  like Hamilton  and that is where the real controversy comes in  They are expensive to film and the rights situation is hard to navigate  It s never financially viable  but it helps support the industry  Stephen Sondheim was a huge proponent of proshots and his PBS proshots inspired a lot of people to like musicals in the first place  There s a circular aspect to this   Hollywood often gets the timing wrong on stuff  like making an Angry Birds movie a decade after it was popular  I don t think there s one answer  It takes a long time to make all the pieces fall into place for any movie ,Discussion,Wicked,0.6052171587944031

individual strengths to bring to life the rapport between Glinda and Elphaba  who ll go on to become the good and wicked witches of Wizard of Oz fame  If as many people love this film as much as I did

of oz stephen schwartz    It s arguable if Wicked could ever be a meaningfully persuasive prequel for the characters in The Wizard of Oz as we actually see them in the 1939 film  as this would involve cancelling their powerfully timeless  mythological aura  and instead substituting the more banal idea of human development  But this is the joke  and this is the story  and what an enjoyable spectacle it is    BBC  3 5   https   www bbc com culture article 20241119 wicked review    It might have been lighter on its feet if the editors had cut a subplot about magical talking animals  which doesn t add anything except several minutes of running time  And they could have cut Elphaba s sister  who is given perplexingly little to do  That way  the film could have been packed the whole musical into one fast moving  satisfying entertainment  As it is  I have a strong suspicion that Wicked will work much better as the first part of a double bill  with Wicked Part 2 being shown after an interval

throughout 2024  I scoured Wikipedia s lists of American films from the last 15 to 40 years  These typical anniversary articles tend to be formulaic  low effort  and rely on nostalgia  I aimed for a mix of noteworthy  meme worthy  iconic  and critically acclaimed  My plan was to post this list on New Year s  but Vanity Fair jumped the gun with their article on The Talented Mr  Ripley  They shared it before the film s actual 25th anniversary in December 2024  breaking the tradition of marking anniversaries in multiples of five years  It appears they couldn t wait another 12 months  So  I

fbcef545fce2b03a13f66a8bb3efbda972af2d6f  The man finally came around      Moana 2    was still on top of the box office  although the gap between it and    Wicked    is becoming smaller  We got two newcomers this week and both were colossal failures     Kraven the Hunter    ended the SSU on a new low  while    The Lord of the Rings  The War of the Rohirrim    finished outside the Top 5  In limited release     Nickel Boys    had a solid start  while    September 5    disappointed   The Top 10 earned a combined  87 6 million this weekend  That s up 27  from last year  when    Wonka    debuted on top      Moana 2    threepeated on the top spot  earning  26 4 million  That s a 48  drop  which is quite rough after its steep second weekend drop  After a record breaking opening weekend  the legs are proving to be quite front loaded  The film has earned  337 3 million  and it s now guaranteed to miss  500 million domestically  And depending on how much it drops against    Mufasa    and    Sonic     it could miss  450 million domestically      Wicked    was still on second place  but it s getting close to    Moana 2     It earned  22 6 million this weekend  which was just 38  down from last weekend  The film has amassed  359 1 million  and it s now poised to earn more domestically than    Moana 2     It could start overtaking it next weekend  assuming it doesn t have a bad drop against    Mufasa    and    Sonic      Debuting in third place     Kraven the Hunter    flopped with just  11 million in 3 211 theaters  That s the worst debut in the SSU  Spider Manless Spider Man Universe   and one of the worst for a Marvel property  Hell  it even debuted below    Kick Ass      19 million   another R rated comic book movie starring Aaron Taylor Johnson   This is not really a surprise  I mean  where do we start   The SSU has earned a cumulative  2 1 billion worldwide  But the  Venom  films account for  1 83 billion of that  which is like 86  of its gross  The other two films     Morbius    and    Madame Web     were critical and commercial duds  becoming Internet s laughingstock  Even the    Venom    films are already losing good will among the general audience  Basically  it s a universe with absolutely nothing to offer  where the bar keeps going lower and lower  Fool me once  shame on you  Fool me six times     But how could    Kraven    open below    Madame Web     On top of having lost any audience interest after the amount of trash released     Kraven    barely felt like a comic book movie  The trailers emphasized brutal action  but it only reinforced that it felt like a generic action flick that come every couple weeks  The character of Kraven might be known for its hunt for Spider Man  yet obviously we find ourselves in another lame attempt to give a villain a standalone origin story  With no signs of Spider Man   For some reason  Sony decided that    Kraven    warranted a big budget  The film was originally set at  90 million  which rose to  110 million due to the strikes  although some reports say that it actually cost  130 million   That s almost on par with the previous    Venom    film  and it s way too high for a C lister  Especially when they made it R rated  Sony is aware that this universe isn t working   TheWrap  https   www thewrap com kraven the hunter sony marvel universe spider man box office   reported that Sony will stop developing films for this universe  choosing to focus on    Spider Man 4        Beyond the Spider Verse    and the    Spider Noir    series  They admitted defeat before the film even came out   There was some slight hope that J C  Chandor s presence would also lead to a competent film  But that was not the case  it s currently at an awful 15  on RT  Nothing but a paycheck    According to Sony  71  of the audience was male  which is higher than usual for a comic book title  40  of the audience was 35 and over  They gave it a horrible  C  on CinemaScore  which is even worse than    Morbius    and    Madame Web     If you think these numbers look bad  just wait for the second weekend drop  Even with the holiday season  it s unlikely    Kraven    can hit  30 million domestically  A comparison could be    Star Trek  Nemesis     which also opened on December 13  After disappointing with  18 million  it closed with just  43 million  If it follows the same trajectory     Kraven    will finish with just  25 million  Yike   After its rough drop     Gladiator II    slightly recovered  It dropped 39   earning  7 6 million this weekend  Looks like    Kraven    barely had an impact  The film has earned  145 7 million  and it should finish with close to  170 million   Barely cracking the Top 5 was    The Lord of the Rings  The War of the Rohirrim     which flopped with just  4 5 million this weekend  There s no point in even comparing it to the    Lord of the Rings    trilogy  which earned over 10 times this number on their first opening weekend   While    The Lord of the Rings    is a massively popular franchise  there was a ceilling to this project when it was announced that it would be an anime prequel  To understand how anime has a ceilling  last year     The Boy and the Heron     with all the buzz it could achieve  made  46 million domestically  That s far less than what other animated films can earn  Warner Bros  knew this couldn t be a big moneymaker  which is why they only spent  30 million on the film  and released it in just 2 602 theaters   It has been reported that the film s existence was fast tracked to prevent New Line from losing the film adaptation rights for Tolkien s novels  Although with the recent announcement of a    Hunt for Gollum    film coming in 2026  it was clear    Rohirrim    wouldn t really be a priority  If people were on the fence over this film  the film s middling reviews  51  on RT  indicated that this wasn t worth it   According to Warner Bros   68  of the audience was male and 66  of the audience was in the 18 34 demographic  They gave it a lukewarm  B  on CinemaScore  far worse than any Middle Earth film  This is not gonna last long in theaters  it d be a surprise if this earned over  15 million lifetime   Despite being available on Prime Video     Red One    dropped just 39  this weekend  adding  4 2 million  The film has earned  92 4 million  and it s fighting to hit  100 million   It took 10 years  but Christopher Nolan s    Interstellar    has crossed  200 million domestically  The IMAX re release added  3 6 million  which was just 21  down from last weekend  Fantastic all around      Pushpa 2  The Rule    fell 67  this weekend  adding  1 6 million and taking its domestic total to  13 million      The Best Christmas Pageant Ever    eased just 14  and added  1 2 million this weekend  That took its domestic total to  36 6 million   Rounding up the Top 10 was Luca Guadagnino s    Queer     which expanded to 460 theaters this weekend  That allowed it to increase again  earning  790 954  The film s domestic total stands at  1 9 million  and it will need some Oscar buzz here      Interstella 5555  The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem    finished outside the Top 10 with  737K during the weekend   2 3 million four day    A24 s    Y2K    lost 160 theaters and fell 68   earning  684 957 this weekend  Through 10 days  the film has earned just  3 7 million  and it s gonna miss  5 million   Paramount released    September 5     an awards hopeful  into 7 theaters  But the film earned  80 802  which translates to a very underwhelming  11 543 per theater average  The film will expand nationwide on January 17  2025  but this is a very weak start   Amazon MGM s    Nickel Boys    debuted in 2 theaters  and earned  54 794 this weekend  That s a solid  27 397 per theater average  and it will continue expanding in the coming weeks   Gia Coppola s    The Last Showgirl    debuted in one single screen  earning  50 300 this weekend  That s a fantastic per theater average  making it the fifth highest of the year  It will hit nationwide in January      OVERSEAS       Moana 2    was once again topping the overseas box office  It added  57 million overseas  taking its worldwide total to  716 8 million  The best markets are France   40 5M   UK   33 5M   Germany   24 8M   Mexico   23 5M  and Brazil   21 1M   It s gonna the billion milestone  but it s taking some time in getting there      Wicked    added  21 5 million  and its worldwide total is now  525 million  It debuted in Germany with  4 million  which is the best for a Broadway film  The film s best markets are the UK   55 2M   Australia   20 1M   Korea   12M   Mexico   9M  and Philippines   5M   It will hit its final market  Japan  on February      Kraven the Hunter    also flopped overseas  It earned just  15 million  taking its worldwide debut to just  26 million  For comparison     Madame Web    earned  49 million on its worldwide debut and closed with just  100 million  There s a strong chance    Kraven    finishes below  60 million worldwide   After missing the mark domestically     The Lord of the Rings  The War of the Rohirrim    also flopped overseas  earning only  4 million overseas  That s a paltry  9 9 million worldwide      FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK    Movie   Release Date   Studio   Domestic Opening   Domestic Total   Worldwide Total

her performance     Smile 3  This Time It s Personal    should be coming anytime now      THIS WEEKEND       Moana 2    will cede the top spot  and it s a battle between a lion and a hedgehog   Disney is releasing    Mufasa  The Lion King     five years after the 2019 remake earned over  1 6 billion worldwide  Jon Favreau was replaced with Barry Jenkins  and the film will serve as a prequel depicting a young Mufasa and Scar  This is a strong IP  but this is uncharted territories  given that this is a completely new story with new songs  It s not gonna come anywhere close to that  1 6 billion gross  but we ll see how much it can make   The other release is    Sonic the Hedgehog 3     The franchise is going strong  and this film has added Keanu Reeves as Shadow  which drew hype among the Internet  The trailers have done a fantastic job in selling the film  and the pre sales look very strong so far  With the holiday corridor  another increase is pretty much imminent   In limited release  A24 is opening Brady Corbet s    The Brutalist     It stars Adrien Brody as L szl  T th  a Hungarian born Jewish architect who survives the Holocaust and emigrates to the United States  where he struggles to achieve the American Dream until a wealthy client changes his life  The film has received fantastic reviews so far  and it s poised to become a big Oscar player  Look for a healthy run  even if the 215 minute runtime might be too much for many                                                                                                 If you re interested in

1h9bzrem11wtec,1h9bzre,m11wtec,freakingfairy,2024-12-08 16:50:46 UTC,,,I would argue the story of act 1 is not incomplete   We see the death of the Wicked Witch of the West and see everything in her early life  focusing on on her time in college with glinda   that brought her to the point of rebellion against the wizard culminating in the musical number to end all musical numbers  Defying Gravity       If this somehow bombed and part 2 was shelved  I think that s enough of a complete story to satisfy      Act 2 of wicked the musical is admittedly much more disjointed and shorter  There s a time skip and it basically covers the events of the Wizard of Oz from a different perspective   I think there s enough material to pull from the Wicked book  the Wizard of Oz and the greater Oz cannon to make something interesting  but time will tell,Discussion,Wicked,0.7412009239196777

surrounding the near term prospects of Warner Bros Pictures   largely stemming from a catastrophic mismanagement of their DC properties  criticism  deserved or otherwise  of CEO and commander in chief David Zaslav  and the debt fallout of one of the worst financial mergers of recent times   In my opinion  the recent handling and deal making of the studio gives reason for significant optimism regarding the outlook of its film division in the coming years  An extremely biased and speculation heavy breakdown follows below     Recent Film Production Deals    A number of promising production and distribution deals have been struct by WBD over the past year and recent months     Coogler Jordan Genre Picture    In recent days  Warners has won a competitive bid for a historical genre pic  rumor around town has it that the film is historically set in a 1930s era film  and is a genre pic involving vampires or other supernatural creatures with possible anime influences   This was undoubtedly seen by the studio to form a relationship with a director star team  in the hope of future films down the road involving the partnership   the fact that this films sounds like it has franchise potential likely is also a big draw for the studio  The Jordan Coogler partnership has been one of the high points of recent years  with films including Fruitville Station  Creed  and Black Panther forming a commercial and critical track record that is praise worthy and sets a high bar for any future partnerships  As an additional note  my feeling is that there is no way Warners would have bowed out of the running for the  28 Days Later  sequels bid against Sony  unless this deal was locked in   and signals that they have strong confidence in the film  The fact that the film is set to enter production in April means that this one may have a fairly quick turn around  with a possible 2025 release     Creature Features    Warners is obviously looking around to establish clear franchise or dependable box office hits  in line with the statements expressed multiple times by Zaslav  One interesting line of potential future avenues to mine  is recent announcements made alluding to bringing back the creature feature style films that was a backbone of WB Old Hollywood offerings in the 50s and 60s  Recent announcements include the soon to start filming Frankenstein s bride inspired flick  starring Christian Bale and Directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal  Additionally  pre production was announced on a reboot of the sci fi Them  with famed Hollywood composer Michael Giacchino tapped to make his big screen directorial debut  and Tim Burton being attached to direct a reboot of Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman with Gillian Flynn on scripting duties     Prestige Pics    There are a number of prestige pictures that have been locked in for production recently  Front of billing on this is Alto Knights  which in my opinion is the largest question mark of the four  Robert De Niro stars in a double billing as 50s mob bosses Vito Genovese and Frank Costello   the film gives off real The Irishman round 2 vibes  A recent surprise was the announcement that Paul Thomas Andersons next had landed at Warners and is currently filming  starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn  Considering the draw of DiCaprio  and track record of brilliance PTA brings  there is high hopes pinned on this one  Juror No 2 is the final film with Clint Eastwood in the directors chair   which presumably Warners will be pinning their advertising on  Considering the criticism Zaslav leveled at the green lighting of Eastwood s previous picture with Warner s  warranted criticism IMHO  considering the general audience and reception of Cry Macho   excepting of course the wisdom in delivering this criticism the way and on the platform that he did   it s likely there is considerably more commercial appeal seen in this one  Here s hoping  Additionally  Warners won a heated auction to the rights for Drowning  The Rescue of Flight 1421  With Paul Greengrass attached to direct this one  and with the amount of heat around Hollywood regarding the Auction for this  this is seen as a promising win for Warners   no doubt they are hoping for a success similar to what Sony found with Captain Phillips  Word is also incredibly strong on the Zach Creggers film Weapons  that Warners  through New Line  again won in a competitive bid with Universal  with a massive deal struck atypical for a director with only one film under his belt  It s a promising sign     The DCU    Obviously  this is the big one  After the disaster  especially in the last two or three years  of the previous DC big screen efforts  Warners needs a massive reset of strategy and leadership  Quality of the films produced  and way out of control budgets  plagued WB with a previous DC slate that has been massively unprofitable   especially when compared to the disproportionate success of the MCU  and the massive amounts of goodwill that was kicked off by the Nolan trilogy  and arguably kicked off the current era of a film landscape dominated by superheroes   The decision to elect James Gunn and Peter Safran to new heads of the rebranded DCU division seems extremely promising  Gunns  Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy closer was a bright spot amongst flagging MCU offerings in the previous year  and he has a proven track record of originality and directorial vision  Initial steps on the film side  such as pre production and casting starts on Superman  Lagacy  The Authority  Batman  The Brave and the Bold  Supergirl  Woman of Tomorrow and Swamp Thing point to a clear roadmap and creative vision  far removed from the scatter gun approach that previous regimes under the Snyder era of DC films seemed to take  It points to a promising sign for future DCU outings on the big screen   and Warners is clearly backing the efforts by Gunn and Safran  as they need this reboot of their most valuable piece of IP to succeed in a big way     Animation Bets    Warner Bros has struggled massively to firmly establish a foothold in the animation division of Hollywood  Intermittent successes  including Iron Giant  Space Jam  Corpse Bride and The Lego Movie  are interspersed with failed efforts and box office disappointments  A couple of interesting developments could spell good things for Warners Animation efforts  however  Shortly after Bill Damaschke was elected as the new head of Warners re branded animation division  Warners inked a first look deal with Locksmith Animation last year  Locksmith is relatively new company  with only one film under its belt   it s first film Ron is Wrong was a surprisingly successful film for a first effort of a fledgling studio  and Warners has signed on to co produce two upcoming productions  Bad Fairies  and The Lunar Chronicles   an adaption of Marissa Meyers bestselling Grimms fairy tales based sci fi novels   Considering comments made by Zaslav that Warners Animation efforts was second only to its DC division  and the long in development films including Toto  Dr Seuss films such as The Cat in the Hat and Oh the Places You ll Go  and legacy WB animation properties such as a Flintstones prequel as well as a number of loony tunes  Hannah Barbera and DC properties  a renewed focus in building out its animation division could yield great returns for Warners Studio efforts as a whole     Renewed Focus on Franchises    One of the foundational messages of the Zaslav era has been a renewed focus on franchises  The Zaslav administration has been extremely busy deal making  with prospective revamps and reboots of what they see as the crown jewels of Warner s existing IP This is all in an attempt to capitalize and grow on successful films that saw them rule the box office landscape in the early and late 2000s   Chief among these is the LOTR deal  which saw Warners broker a deal with the Tolkien estate to produce multiple new films based on the LOTR books  As one of the most beloved trilogies of all time  The Lord of the Rings represents a massive opportunity for Warners if done well   Harry Potter is also seeing renewed focus   with a TV remake of the books in production at HBO  However  Zaslav has noted that they are exploring further opportunities to capitalize and explore Rowling s world  With the relative failure of the Fantastic Beasts franchise  this IP still represents a massive opportunity for the studio on the big screen  With the renewed focus on the franchise  no doubt options are being explored to further capitalize on this IP and develop feature films   Announcements have also been made on legacy sequel bets  to make the most of the IP Warners has sitting unused  Most notably  I am Legend 2  Oceans 11 Prequel  with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling   a Constantine Sequel  The Accountant Sequel  Sherlock  and the currently filming Beetlejuice Beetlejuice have all received production or press updates in recent months  With a aim to re capitalise on existing IP  movement on one or many of the above is incredibly likely in the next few years   Additional entries in the currently successful franchises of the wider Conjuring verse  as well as the Monster verse  Godzilla and Kong related entries  are likely to continue and seem set for semi regular large screen entries for the next several years to come     First Look Deals    Several deals have been struck recently  that bodes well for Warners re establishing itself as a creator s studio  The recent partnership deal between Tom Cruise and Warners received a massive amount of press  However  this will likely be years away from yielding any fruit   as Mission Impossible  and the Liman space film  and possibly a further Top Gun sequel  will likely keep him busy in the near future  However  it s nevertheless a good get for the studio  First look deals have also been recently been struck with Margot Robbie  ohn M  Chu  M  Night Shyamalan  Baz Luhrman  John M Chu  Shyamalan  Baz Luhrman  Matt Reeves  Andy Muschietti  Todd Phillips and Bradley Cooper   cementing the idea that Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy are hard at work  re establishing ties with the film making community  and increasing the likelihood of exciting future projects making a home at the studio in the next several years     Debt Trap Leadership    A tremendous amount of criticism has been levelled at Zaslav  and by proxy Warner Bros  due to the treatment of a number of films shelved due to tax reasons  Principal among these include Scoob 2  Batgirl  and the recent Coyote vs  Acme  Accusation and rather insane rants have been directed at Zaslav in a torrent of very stern words over the internet over the previous year  However  this vastly mis understands the reason Zaslav was elected to the top position   Warners  at the time of Zaslav gaining the top position  was beset with a mountain of insane levels of debt  that still threaten the overall company with bankruptcy   the debt largely stemming from the catastrophic AT T acquisition and Discovery merger  Previous studio heads  when the economy was cooking and money flowing  had made some nonsensical studio decisions  These included greenlighting enormously budgeted films with very little sense in how these would make back their budgets   namely DC movies with enormous budgets and very low likelihood of success  especially in direct competition with a well oiled MCU machine   This was also combined with a mistreatment of potential reboot and franchise opportunities  The Matrix  Fantastic Beasts and Space Jam come to mind   the financial and reputational disaster of direct release films to MAX during the Covid epidemic  and lack of focus on the IP Warners did own  It was a train wreck   the fact that Godzilla vs Kong  A Conjuring Movie  Dune  Barbie and Wonka were the only significant successes  excluding some minor successes in between  in the four year stretch from 2020 to 2023 signals just how dire the previous leadership was  given the production and financial decisions   Looking at the films realistically  the first Scoob was critically a dud  and commercially did not make a dent  granted this was during Covid   From a financial point of view  this sequel film had little to none chance of success  especially considering the advertising and screening costs to get the film in theatres   Zaslav was undoubtably correct that his was more valuable as a write off than a release  Batgirl  again from the looks of it  was in dire straits  Pre screening reviews and studio notes indicated this was not a top tier DC film  a fairly low bar given their near term previous output   and had a unfeasibly high budget for any kind of direct to MAX release   again  this was a film riddled with the financial malpractice decision making of the previous leadership  The C vs A film was a little different granted   the early word and reviews were great  scoring extremely high reviews  However  given the animation style and general budget  this was not going to be a film that represented any kind of real profit for the film  Chief in point   Warners set the film for sale and has only just been finally put down to rest in the last few days  Warners would likely have accepted any offer from another studio  that would have granted them more cash than the tax write off from shelving the pic altogether  The fact that no other studio was willing to pony up the capital for this speaks volumes   it s a shame for the creatives and workers on the film  and it may have been a good film  but Zaslav is ultimately charged with righting a financially sinking ship  Nothing in the above suggests he made the wrong decision   As a side note slightly separate to the film side of the Warners business   Another controversial decision has included the licencing out the valuable film and TV properties to other streaming services  rather than a straight exclusive to MAX approach  However  Warners had the only successful streaming service  except for Netflix I believe  last quarter  and the revenues gained from licencing film and TV properties  for example  the friends TV show of the DCU films  will massively help cash flow and debt paydown  This seems like a smart move from Zaslav  especially considering the mountains of cash that Paramount  Disney etc  have thrown at streaming platforms with no as yet profit to show for it     2024    There is a fantastic breakdown of the 2024 WB films here by  valkyria  knight881  https   www reddit com user valkyria knight881   which I encourage you to read   https   www reddit com r boxoffice comments 184ty4f a  look  into  warner  bros  pictures  2024  the  new  era  utm  source

share utm medium web3x utm name web3xcss utm term 1 utm content share button   However  as general comment  I see this as one of the strongest film slates  and definitely the most interesting  of the major studios for the year   I ll breakdown what I see as the largest films of each of the major studios below   note that personal discretion and interest has very much played a part in what films have gotten a mention below  and I ve generally covered films that have been produced by the respective studios and excluded distribution only films  Granted  there are some films likely undated and may be added to the 2024 slate later down the track  But by all means  feel free to nitpick  and include films I ve missed out in the comments of this post     Competitor Studios   Disney    The major competitor is obviously Disney  however the behemoth that is the MCU is absent except for Deadpool 3  which is in my opinion  controversially  somewhat over hyped  As I see it  the R rating and fatigue regarding the MCU studio offerings may play a limiting factor to the films overall Box Office   The big plays are largely isolated to Animated  or Animation to Live Action films  Inside Out 2 and Moana 2 are locks for successful BO takes  Note that Moana was the most streamed film over the previous year  which bodes very well for its success   with Mufasa  The Lion King being a little more uncertain in terms of potential success  Considering the massive debut of the original Lion King Live Action Remake however  I can t see how this one doesn t result in a significant success for the studio  Other studio bets include the 20th Century Studios releases of Alien  Romulus and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes   however the first is an essential reboot after several less than impressive offerings in the franchise  and the last is a reboot after the conclusion of the previous trilogy  Anything is possible if these turn out to be incredibly well made films here  however these are franchise beginning films rather than concluding set pieces  which may result in slightly dampened Box Office earnings compared to the blockbuster 2019 and prior years for the studio     Competitor Studios   Paramount    The only real lock for Paramount this year in my opinion  is likely to be A Quiet Place   Day One  Previous entries in the franchise were staggeringly well made  did incredibly well commercially and critically   and is genuinely one of the most exciting new franchises out of Hollywood in the last half decade  However  they do have several interesting bets on the docket for the year  IF appears very much targeted towards a young children family audience and so may play well to an under served demographic   but this may also be to its detriment  by limiting target audience overall for the film  Krasinski really scored for Paramount with A Quiet Place previously  so he may work some magic  and catch lightening in a bottle for a second time  However  response to initial trailers is fairly muted  granted it is very early to make a call here   Beverly Hills  and Animated Transformers Prequel and Sonic are likely to be successful   however the first is a legacy sequel with target appeal very much limited to an older nostalgia demographic  Transformers has had a history of declining BO over the previous decade  and Sonic has been mildly successful  with what I see as limited upside potential on previous films  Gladiator 2 is the real wildcard for the year   a massive nostalgia play on a film that absolutely broke the box office doors a couple of decades ago  It will very much depend on execution  and trying to light up interest among a younger audience for the sword and sandal epics that were once so successful in a Hollywood era  previous to the current superhero dominant fare  Note that this is a co production with Universal  which I have not included in the studio run down below     Competitor Studios   Universal    Universal has a number of interesting films for the year  and rivals Warners in terms of breadth in their offerings  Their animation offerings are particularly promising  Kung Fu Panda 4 and Despicable Me 4 will likely do gangbusters for obvious reasons that aren t worth justifying  and The Wild Robot is the first serious new franchise play in a while for Dreamworks  The studio seems high on prospects for this one  The fact that Chris Sanders has been tapped to direct this picture is an obvious point of confidence for the film  considering his previous track record  The Monkey Man  by all accounts rescued by Jordan Peele for a theatrical release  will likely be successful   this years The Beekeeper has shown there is legs in these John Wick style flicks  as long as they are competently made and with a budget kept under control  The Fall Guy  Twisters and Wicked  Part One are the big budget gambles for the year  Early notes on The Fall Guy seem extremely positive  and Gosling has hardly put a foot wrong in recent years   all signs point to an outsized success for the film  Twisters may be a bit more of a roll of the dice   However a bankful of cash has been thrown at the film  and a who s who of young up and coming stars  Daisy Edgar Jones  Glen Powell and Anthony Ramos  has been assembled  with an acclaimed indie director on the rise  Lee Isaac Chung  of Minari fame  to lead the film   Note   Warners is a co producer of this film  which I ve excluded from the studio rundown further down this post   Wicked also seems like a lock for success as one of the most beloved musicals of recent years and seems uniquely suited for a big screen adaption  The Blumhouse produced Wolfman could go either way   but the studio is very good at delivering on tightly budgeted horror films  Of perhaps more limited box office appeal are The Bikeriders and Nosferatu   but word from festival screenings of The Bikeriders is phenomenal  and while Robert Eggers produces highly divisive films  he certainly creates films that are singular and unique  I m rooting for both  if only on the chance that more of these non franchise studio bets get made in future     Competitor Studios   Sony    Sony continues with its efforts to spin off a Spiderman derived universe of its own superhero films  It may be my own personal bias speaking  but I have very little hope that these will see any significant box office success  I m expecting that Madame Web and Kraven the Hunter both dive and bomb  with Venom 3 likely to make a modest profit when all the chips have fallen   but hey  here s hoping I m wrong  Sony also has a couple of potential franchise starters slated for the year   including an animated reboot of Garfield  a fourth Bad Boys film  and a Karate Kid film  Garfield could over perform  but any out sized expectations by way of last years The Super Mario Bros Movie is far and away overshooting the profit potential of this flick in my opinion  and is likely to make a much more modest profit overall  Bad boys will likely still be overshadowed by Will Smiths  precipitous decline in cultural cache and popularity  as he is nowhere near the draw that he previously would have been even a decade ago  for a return to a beloved franchise  The karate kid movie might surprise   the recent TV adaption has generated a renewed interest and critical acclaim in the franchise  However it remains to be seen if this can be translated onto the big screen  and may not lend itself well to the current effects heavy era of action films that have performed well in the current box office environment  Ghostbusters the frozen empire will likely do well  Its one of the franchises Sony is clearly carefully producing  and the previous entry was well executed and budgeted  if not exactly awe inspiring      Warner Bros    I see Warners as having the most impressive and diverse slate for the year  especially given the comparative emptiness in the box office lineup when looking at previous years  Godzilla x Kong is likely to continue being a strong franchise performer  especially considering the surprise outsized success of Godzilla Minus One recently  indicating stong interest from audiences to witness super powered megafauna wreak general havoc on the big screen  Dune  Part Two in my opinion is likely to surprise on the upside   its previous entry was considered a rare win during the Covid era box office  and combined with the Chalamet Zendaya draw  critical reception of the previous film  and relatively empty release window that it debuts into  the potential on this one is extremely promising  Furiosa is a wild card  The Miller Mad Max pics are extremely expensive  but essentially fills a niche of its own   being a heavily stylised  frenetic box office action picture  It will be one to watch  to see if it can justify the budget allotted  and make a healthy profit  The Shyamalan one two of The Watchers and Trap  the first by Shayamalan the younger  the second by Shyamalan the older  will likely continue the low budget horror that Warners has seen success with in the past  and further cement the relationship with the family that Warners clearly wants to continue  Joker  Folie a Deux follows up one of the most profitable big budget pictures of the last decade  with a surprise swing into musical territory  Phillips has shown himself as a auteur who can deliver in a big way in the box office   I don t see the outsized success of Joker repeating it s insane debut run  but this is likely to do very good numbers  Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is the nostalgia play for the year  and a bit of a question mark  Considering WB recently tapped Burton for a remake of Attack of the 50ft Women  they are likely high on this film  And there is a significant amount of good will on the still popular original film 36 years on from its original debut date  I m pegging this to surprise on the upside   Burton is due a win  after the last few relative disappointments  LOTR   The War of the Rohirrim is a hard one to parse  Initially pegged as an IP placeholder  it s a bit of a trial for Hollywood into anime inspired animation territory  Warners has struggled to establish an animation division in recent years  after the initial Lego movie success petered out   but Zaslav has indicated a real desire to mine LOTR as one of the most significant pieces of IP WB owns  and could yield a real avenue for future sequels and spin offs  it this one delivers  Warners has one other insane bet with Kevin Costners Horizon duo of films out in 2024  The unique release strategy  releasing the films two months apart  and subject matter  inter generational westerns haven t been the go to for new hollywood box office properties since the 70s  makes this a dubious bet  However WB have hedged the financials well on this movie  Costner and outside funding has contributed to the lions share of the production budget   and the yellowstone driven revival of western properties in general might drive a significant audience to Costners  big gamble  if given the chance  This is definitely a wait and see  Mickey 17 is another big franchise bet for the studio  Big screen hard sci fi has been a tricky ask for hollywood profit wise  however Warners did magic with the Dune film  and are clearly hoping for a repeat  Bong Joon Ho directs this one  and Robert Pattinson starts  so it has no shortage of talent attached  I see this as being a difficult sell  but one that could be a revelation if all goes well     Final Thoughts    There are more thoughts on potential franchises  opportunities and leverage points for Warners film division   particularly exploiting IP it owns through Warner Brothers TV series  which is a massive opportunity waiting to be exploited  There are parts of the film division I ve largely left unmentioned   such as the  elseworld  section of the DC universe forming  currently consisting of the Joker and Pattinson Batman franchises  But that might all have to wait for a future post  All in ll  I m incredibly excited at the future prospects of Warner Brothers  after a fairly dire previous few years  and what I consider to be dubious management at a studio level  If you made it this far   cheers  Looking forwards to hearing your thoughts in the comments ,Discussion,Wicked,0.7213369011878967

1bs6uuvkxegwm8,1bs6uuv,kxegwm8,tomingram99,2024-03-31 14:34:33 UTC,,,I had exactly the same problem with this film  I think for me  the gross feeling the film gave me has to do with the fact that the Dame is a clear underdog in the story  and the film doesn t give the audience any reason to believe Adonis deserves to beat him apart from the fact that he is our protagonist  So essentially  we re expected to root for the wealthy  famous world champion  born of boxing royalty  over the down on his luck underdog who s dreams were shattered as a kid  getting the shot he s waited for his whole life  Additionally  it has to do with the way Dame is treated after beating Adonis despite the fact nobody knew he had done so via nefarious means at the time  which feels bizarre and icky  I wrote about it when I saw it   Dame is the ostensible antagonist of the film  He s introduced as an extremely sympathetic character  Adonis  closest friend when they were kids  who s spent the last 18 years in prison because he pulled a gun to protect him  Dame is the ultimate underdog  starting from square one  grasping for just a single piece of his dreams that were shattered when he was a boy  Adonis on the other hand  is everything that s aspired to in Western  particularly American  culture  He s essentially a chosen one  a regular kid who finds out he s actually special when told who his father is  and then goes on to embody American individualism  working his way to the top of the socio economic ladder and winning at capitalism by becoming rich and famous  It seems obvious  if we remove the names of these characters  which one we d ordinarily be rooting for   Dame is the underdog  the dreamer who gets his title shot  It s the Rocky story  and    he actually wins  But for some reason  everybody  including his closest friend Adonis immediately resents him for it  It feels all wrong  It wasn t supposed to happen  Now sure  he fights a little dirty at times during the bout  but he s duly punished with a points deduction  and in the end  he wins the fight fair and square  and is clearly the deserving winner  Later on the film reveals that he orchestrated this title shot via nefarious means  but in the moment  the reaction to his victory comes off plain gross and ugly  It feels elitist and exclusive  like the members of the rich and successful upper class turning their noses up at the idea of a regular joe being able to reach their level  It doesn t matter that the film recontextualises it later  because in the moment Adonis wasn t aware of Dame s wrongdoing  and yet he still turned his back on him   If anything  the choice to reveal that Dame used wicked means to get his shot after the fact feels like a weak attempt by the filmmakers to give us a reason to root against a character who would otherwise be more deserving of our support than our righteous  protagonist   In the end  Dame is  put in his place  by Adonis when he wins his title back  his repaired childhood dreams snatched from him by the friend he shattered them for in the first place protecting  It all feels wrong  and the film seems blissfully unaware of this ,Discussion,Wicked,0.6842097043991089

1gmzn07lw79agc,1gmzn07,lw79agc,Other-Marketing-6167,2024-11-09 04:20:15 UTC,,,I m probably gonna repost my Tony Todd story on every subreddit that has this  but I don t care  Dude was fucking amazing   So here I am 10 years ago a wannabe filmmaker  I get a gig taking pics at a small town Star Trek convention a month before I started filming my second big fat failure of a feature  Tony Todd was one of the three actors there  ironically they ve died too   Starbuck from Galactica and Christina Hicks  and was damn near the coolest  nicest guy I ve ever met    Treated every fan dressed as a Klingon like a rock star  When things died down in an embarrassing way  the event was not well marketed  he slept on the pool table and saw me try and open a package of ink cartridges then leapt up and ripped it open like a hilarious Viking  He took a picture of me with  the my Bluray of The Rock  and recorded a birthday message for my buddy who watched that movie with me all the time in film school    And man  did he listen  I mentioned my shitty no budget movie I was making soon  He asked all about it  talked about it  laughed at how I wouldn t even need permits cause it was being shot in my home town  I ve regretted ever since I didn t  yknow  talk about HIS upcoming projects  but I was nervous and didn t expect him to seem to care about a total fucking nobody  I left that day feeling like a million bucks    When a douche from town tried to interview him for a stupid webpage video the next day  I said I would help with secondary camera  He recited an epic and side splitting made up story about learning acting from aliens and the douche director waited ten full mins to tell him the Zoom wasn t turned on  And he had to redo everything  Most actors would ve flipped their shit  deservedly  He just groaned  and told the real story of his life as boringly as possible  That wicked sci fi story is forever lost in time  I felt so bad  but fuck he took it like a champ   When it was done  I was lugging camera equipment out the door and he was going into his shitty small town limo  He stopped  popped back out  and asked if I needed a ride somewhere  I said I was good and lived cause I lived in that crappy town  and he shook my hand and wished me luck on my movie  Never saw him again    Coolest fucking guy I ever met    My movie turned out so bad it never left post production  and I basically gave up filmmaking since  But I did write half of another flick and wrote the main villain role with Tony Todd in mind  My dream was to someday finish  sell it  and get to hire him in the role I wrote specifically for him as a thank you for inspiring and helping a total nobody like myself   I m legitimately sad that ll never happen now  Rest in peace  my famous friend of one solitary weekend ,News,Wicked,0.3864344358444214

1fycscflqte7e3,1fycscf,lqte7e3,babbitygook14,2024-10-07 18:28:19 UTC,,,It s mostly because Hollywood is terrified of musicals being musicals  They think general adult audiences won t go see a musical in theaters  completely forgetting that Broadway exists and millions of people go see Broadway shows  They also forget that there is a large population of people who can t afford to go see Broadway shows and would like to be able to see them in a movie theater    I m really hoping Wicked changes this perspective in the same way that Chicago did for a while ,Discussion,Wicked,0.7187917232513428

track of every movie I ve seen in a theater  along with dates scores ticket stubs theaters etc   In theaters  I saw  5 movies in 2015  9 movies in 2016  146 movies in 2017  162 movies in 2018  192 movies in 2019  44 movies in 2020  86 movies in 2021  and 270 movies in 2022  This is my 6th year doing this ranking on  r movies   This year  I was able to break my personal record and see 325 different movies in theaters  I went to 7 film festivals and saw movies in 39 different theaters  67 screenings had cast and or filmmakers crew present for Q As  and there were a few dozen North American   World Premieres  I went to re watch 6 movies and there are a handful of special re releases included   My rankings reviews aren t meant to be taken super seriously  it s just something I like to do for fun  I don t keep a checklist or requirement for any ranking  it s mostly just an enjoyment scale  Basically  7 10 is a  good to amazing    5 6 is  I had issues with and would probably never watch again   and 4 or less were just different levels of bad terrible  I am not a professional movie reviewer in any way  I just like watching movies   The genres I usually stay away from are horror  documentary  surrealism fantasy  and animation  but I make exceptions often  That being said  here s my ranking of every movie I saw in theaters in 2023                                                                       Tori and Lokita     10 10    The kind of movie that makes your blood boil  with a final 10 minutes that will stick in your head for a while  Two unknown actors in their first movie ever manage to build one of the most beautiful heartwrenching believable relationships I ve ever seen on the big screen  It s short  but extremely potent  I don t think I ve ever been as emotionally invested in a main character s struggles as I was for this movie  The Dardenne Brothers have a really unique way of connecting you to a story       Falcon Lake     10 10    Maybe the best Canadian debut film   ever  Amazingly acted  beautifully shot  painfully relatable  and smothered in a very eerie   haunting atmosphere  It s part ghost story  and part coming of age  Loved the existential dread  the dance scene  and the score especially  The director  Charlotte Le Bon  is my  best breakout  pick of the year      Oppenheimer     9 10     I Like Movies     9 10    Non stop laughs with lots of heart thrown in  A nostalgic crowd pleaser  Romina D Ugo s monologue scene halfway through was one of the most well acted moments of the year  Kind of an ode to movie nerds everywhere      Barbie     9 10    Mission Impossible  Dead Reckoning Part 1     9 10  The Top Gun Maverick of 2023  A near perfect summer action blockbuster that s just a thrill ride from start to finish  Need one of these once in a while      Anatomy of a Fall     9 10  Perfectly crafted courtroom thriller  A lot funnier than I expected too  especially the back and forth between the lawyers  Sandra Hueller was Oscar worthy  Snoop is a lock for Doggo of the Year award  and 50 Cent s P I M P has never been better      Stop Making Sense    Re Release    9 10    I hadn t seen this before  but an IMAX re release seemed like the perfect moment  No regrets  instantly my favorite concert film of all time  The energy and joy was contagious  and the set changes graphics were mesmerizing      Killers of the Flower Moon     9 10     Blackberry     9 10    A smart   funny white collar crime biopic  120 minutes flew by  learned a lot of things I didn t know about Blackberry  Jay Baruchel   Glenn Howerton were a perfect duo for this  I love The Big Short and this reminded of that in a lot ways      The Zone of Interest     9 10     War Pony     9 10    It s mind blowing that this was made by first time directors  writers  actors  A slow simmering drama set on a Native American reservation  It just felt so honest  Love movies that have 2 completely different storylines that slowly   realistically merge as the movie goes along      His Three Daughters     9 10    My biggest surprise at TIFF  It wasn t really on my radar but Elizabeth Olsen s performance blew me away  definitely a career best for her  Cried a few times throughout  capped off with really beautiful ending sequence  It s really about accepting death and the unbreakable bonds of family  all within the confines of a small urban apartment  I feel like this ll be one of Netflix s big Oscar plays for 2024  Olsen and Carie Coon especially deserver a lot of praise  One of the best family dramas in a while      The Holdovers     8 10    Got to love a perfectly written  smart  heartwarming  Christmas time story of 3 lonely people that learn to open up to each other  Huge bounceback from Downsizing for Alexander Payne  This ll go on the annual holiday rotation for sure      Flora and Son     8 10    I love John Carney s movies  They are always sweet  heartwarming  funny  and filled with legitimately catchy and great songs  Once is a favorite of mine  and Begin Again is also amazing   This was no exception  Carney was there in person for this one and at the end played the big song of the movie on guitar and had the whole audience sing along  1500  people   Very cool moment and a cute song  Eva Hewson was infectiously sweet and kinf of a revelation  If I had a nickel for every Apple  movie that used Joni Mitchell s Both Sides Now for their emotional climax  I d have two nickels  which isn t many but it s weird that it happened twice      Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person     8 10    It doesn t revolutionize anything but I really enjoyed this funny  lowkey  vampire coming of age movie  Best way to describe it would be  A great blend of Raw  Before Sunrise  Let The Right One In  and What We Do In the Shadows  and Warm Bodies  French Canadian cinema is on the rise and I m fully on board      Hit Man     8 10    Richard Linklater in top form  A sharp  sexy  fun crime comedy  Glen Powell and Adria Arjona play perfectly off of each other  Was really impressive by Powell s acting chops in this  Especially during the montage of him with his different personalities  I could ve wathced 90 minutes of that  Shame this was picked up by Netflix and won t get a proper theatrical release in 2024  It could ve been a real crowd pleaser with a big audience      The Promised Land     8 10     The Eight Mountains     8 10    Very moving emotional story  It finds a delicate balance between deep existential dread and quite hopefulness for the future  I love a movie that makes you feel nostalgic for something you didn t experience yourself  This movie did that  non stop  for 140 minutes  A very moving father son relationship too  The soundtrack from Daniel Norgren was perfect  I ve had it on my playlist ever since   it felt like the movie couldn t exist without the album  and vice versa   The constant time jumps can get a bit confusing but the narration helps smoothen that out  Jawdropping backgrounds of the Italian Alps  I couldnt wrap my head around how they were able to get some of the shots they got  Looked better than a  100M  budget movie at times      The Bikeriders     8 10      They Cloned Tyrone     8 10    Jamie Foxx with the most underrated performance of the year      The Iron Claw     8 10    A movie that keeps kicking you while you re down  holy shit  Go in prepared for an emotional rollercoaster      Bottoms     8 10    Probably the most quotable movie of the year  I could see this becoming a cult classic down the road  Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri are a perfect comedic pairing  It s absurd in all of the right ways  Side note  more movies should play the blooper reels during the credits      Priscilla     8 10    The only movie I went to see 3 times in theaters this year  once with Cailee Spaeny in attendance  The fact that this was left off of the Best Makeup   Hairstyle Oscar shortlist is a crime against humanity and someone should be jailed      Saltburn     8 10     Riceboy Sleeps     8 10      Living     8 10     All of Us Strangers     8 10    The last 30 minutes of this movie caused an orchestra of cry sniffles in the audience like I ve never heard before      Leave the World Behind     8 10     Dumb Money     8 10     Air     8 10    20 Days In Mariupol     8 10    Incredibly brave filmmaking  Maybe the first time I had to physically look away from the screen during a movie  Really tough watch  but important  Best documentary of the year      Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  Mutant Mayhem     8 10    My  1 animated movie of the year  Loved the animation style  humor  and soundtrack      The Beasts     8 10    Talk to Me     8 10    Questionable police work aside  this was my favorite horror movie of the year  Disclaimer  I usually skip most horror movies        The Royal Hotel     8 10    A very tight  tense  claustrophobic thriller set in the Australian outback  It really plays against expectations and doesn t follow the road you d expect  Kitty Green is a very promising filmmaker  I also really liked The Assistant a few years ago       American Fiction     8 10    Poor Things     8 10    Past Lives     8 10    The Teacher s Lounge     8 10    Guardians of the Galaxy  Volume 3     8 10    A nice sendoff to one of the better superhero trilogies  Lots of laughs  great songs  emotional moments  In a year full of comic book flops  this was one of the few bright spots      The Creator     8 10    Spider Man  Across the Spider Verse     8 10     Dicks  The Musical     8 10     Dungeons   Dragons  Honor Among Thieves     8 10    Sequel please      I Used To Be Funny     8 10    A really solid drama that gives Rachel Sennott all the room in the world to shine  Her background as a comedian really made her stand up scenes very convincing and realistic  The flashback scenes take a bit of getting used to in the beginning but once they click  they really work  Bonus points for some Phoebe Bridgers bangers on the soundtrack      Creed III     8 10    Maestro     8 10    Masterfully crafted with 2 towering lead performances   There s a saying that goes  never stand under a bird that s full of shit   and I ve been standing under one for much too long  is one of my favorite lines of the year  Gorgeous cinematography  including one of the best individual shots of the year  Carey Mulligan standing in Lenny s shadow       How to Have Sex     8 10    An impressive debut film  In my head canon  this is in the same universe as Aftersun  it had a very familiar feel  A care free summer in a Mediterranean coast setting takes a darker turn  If you loved Aftersun  like me   you ll love this      Klondike     8 10    John Wick  Chapter 4     8 10    Quick shoutout to the overhead fire shotgun scene  that shit was badass  The John Wick series is like a shot of movie adrenaline  My major complaint was that it gets a bit exhausting repetitive in the final third  the movie feels too long      The Covenant     8 10    Beyond Utopia     8 10    It s 2 stories of attempted defection from North Korea  with 2 completely different results  It s really half documentary and half real life thriller  with the stakes being literal death        Taylor Swift  The Eras Tour     8 10    Top notch visuals  production  sound  dance sequences  etc  Overall a really good concert movie with amazing energy  1989 and Red especially were non stop great songs  Loved the slow dancing part near the beginning   Betty    All Too Well   and  the 1  were instantly added to my playlist after the movie  There are a lot of  how in the world did they get this shot during a live concert  moments       Cairo Conspiracy     8 10    Ferrari     8 10    Concrete Utopia     8 10   If you can get past the weird tonal shift  it starts off like a really funny satire and slowly becomes a more serious apocalyptic drama  and clunky religious allegorical ending  this was a really good one  It was a lot more graphic than expected which I liked      Theater Camp     8 10    Titanic    Re Release    8 10     The Duel     8 10    Pretty crazy that this movie hasn t found a distributor  It s a really solid indie movie about 2 ex best friends that decide to settle their relationship dispute with a good ole  fashioned pistol duel down in Mexico  It takes really wild and surreal turns      Somewhere In Queens     8 10    You Hurt My Feelings     8 10    Still  A Michael J  Fox Movie     8 10    Maybe the most well edited documentary since Apollo 11  Loved the way the movie TV scenes were intertwined in such a unique way with the documentary      La Chimera     8 10    Loved the beautiful blend of the mystical and the whimsical  Really great ending  It s a movie that s really hard to describe  Part heist caper  part existential love story  part absurdist comedy mystery  It doesn t belong in any one box  Carol Duarte was mesmerizing as Italia      The Origin of Evil     8 10    Paris Memories     8 10    The Man in the Basement     8 10    Les Indesirables     8 10    It doesn t quite reach the emotional heights as his previous movie  Les Miserables   but Ladj Ly still builds a strong and engaging political social drama  Anta Diaw was the real standout  she was amazing      Ru     8 10    Emily     8 10    Monster     8 10    Showing Up     8 10    Memory     8 10    The scene where the 2 daughters confront their mom about their father s actions was one of the most heartwrenching scenes of the year  Incredibly well written and acted movie       The Worst Ones     8 10     Napoleon     8 10    Only In Theaters     8 10    RRR     8 10    Fun choreography  for both songs and fights   and over the top ridiculous action scenes  The 3 hour  runtime flew by  I don t think my eardrums will ever recover from the abuse they took during this screening though  It was almost worth permanent hearing damage  almost      The Last Rider     8 10    Women Talking     8 10    Evil Does Not Exist     8 10    Perfect Days     8 10    It s about enjoying the little things in life  and staying positive  and I loved it for that  Therapy in movie form      The Abyss    Re Release    8 10     How To Blow Up A Pipeline     8 10    The Persian Version     8 10    A sweet  colorful  music filled  funny  and heartwarming immigrant story that clearly comes from a very personal place  I liked the stylistic choices made  freeze frames  animated parts  and breaking the 4th wall   I just wish they would have been more consistent  The freeze frames and animated portions were only in the first act  then completely disappear for the rest of the movie       A Good Person     8 10    Amazing performance from Florence Pugh  especially during the AA meeting monologue  Morgan Freeman seemed like he cared for the first time in two decades  If it wasn t for a ridiculous third act scene  this could ve been higher  It surprisingly manages to land the ending      American Symphony     8 10     Sidney     8 10    Yelling Fire In An Empty Theater     8 10    I had very low expectations going in  not something I d ever thought I d like  but it really grew on me and I found it very charming and witty  It s basically a student film made by a bunch of friends in a random apartment for less than  3 000  shot on a VHS quality mini dv camera about a pretty generic story  a naive girl goes to the big city   Really adorable performance by Isadora Leiva  Nowhere near as technically impressive or well made as 99  of movies on this list  but it was a nice little mumblecore tribute gem that s hard to describe      The Good Half     8 10     Day of the Fight     8 10     The Settlers     8 10    Dark  violent  anti colonialist  and unflinchingly bloody Western set in South America  If you liked Hostiles  you ll like this  It also deals with the political aftermath of the atrocities committed on the lawless lands  which I thought was an interesting       Passages     8 10     Are You There God  It s Me  Margaret       8 10    Rachel McAdams deserves more recognition for what she did in the movie  Sweet little 1970s coming of age movie  Also  I love how Ben Safdie just shows up in stuff and kills it      Between Two Worlds     7 10    Dream Scenario     7 10    It actually didn t get as wild as I d hoped it would  Above average as far as recent Cage projects go      The Burial     7 10    A well made  feel good  David v Goliath courtroom drama that gets a bit too preachy near the end  but a really fun   hammy show offy performance from Jamie Foxx balanced by a good and grounded Tommy Lee Jones one keep this nice and balanced  Gives very early 2000s vibes but it works      May December     7 10    Killer score  setting  and a top tier performance from Natalie Portman kept this interesting  but I just found it too melodramatic and dry to be great  I was lucky enough to see this at the Savannah SCAD Film Festival  where it was filmed  and seeing local landmarks throughout the movie along with crowd reactions as they came up was fun  Todd Haynes  the director  did an intro at the beginning and asked everyone in the audience that worked on the movie to stand up for an ovation  and at least 100 cast   crewmembers were present  Really cool moment  love stuff like that      Sanctuary     7 10     Eileen     7 10    Polite Society     7 10    Shades of Scott Pilgrim vs the World      Woman of the Hour     7 10    Really confident true crime thriller from Anna Kendrick  Daniel Zovatto was super menacing and believable as real life serial killer Rodney Alcada  He was born to play a role like that  perfect fit  It gets slowed down by a lot of the genre cliches but still solid for a directorial debut  The kill scenes are particularly brutal  like Holy Spider last year      The Hunger Games  The Ballad of Songbirds   Snakes     7 10    Maybe a bit heavy on the singing  especially the scene where the gets picked for the games  very awkward  and fan service  but totally understandable  If you want to revive a dormant mega franchise  you re gonna have to crack a few nostalgia eggs and give your lead something unique to do  Rachel Zegler and Jason Schwartzman and Peter Dinklage were great  Viola Davis was a bit much  I like a good non superhero villain origin story once in a while  The Childhood of a Leader  We Need to Talk About Kevin  etc       It Ain t Over     7 10     Blue Jean     7 10     A Little Prayer     7 10    Godzilla Minus One     7 10    The Super Mario Bros  Movie     7 10    Expats     7 10    I could watch the cover of Katy Perry s  Roar  by the maids  choir at the beginning on an infinite loop      Inside     7 10     Asteroid City     7 10    Like The French Dispatch before it  I wanted to love this  but couldn t get there  It s got an amazing cast  sets  and lines  but Wes Anderson is getting to be a more  style over substance  for me recently  Like Alex Garland      Infinity Pool     7 10    Broker     7 10    Full Time     7 10    Waitress  The Musical     7 10    Very charming musical that s just a bit too long  Sara Bareilles is a treasure and  She Used To Be Mine  is one my favorite musical songs ever  That song alone was worth the price of admission  Also all of those delicious looking pies  Hmmmmmmm  pies      A Haunting In Venice     7 10    Not as good as the first movie  but better than the second   I could watch Kenneth Branagh hamming it up as Poirot for as long as he wants to keep making them      No Hard Feelings     7 10     Strays     7 10    Yes  it s dumb and outdated  Yes  I still had fun and laughed a bunch  No  I am not ashamed   ok maybe I am a little ashamed      The Blackening     7 10    The Good Mother     7 10    Rustin     7 10    Carmen     7 10    Great dance sequences and music  Nice chemistry between the two leads  Paul Mescal and Melissa Barrero   I just wish they leaned more into the Bonnie   Clyde lovers on the run aspect and less into the fantasy surrealism      Sisu     7 10    Scream VI     7 10    Hell of a Summer     7 10    For a non horror fan  this was a nice throwback campground slasher  It plays it pretty safe but everyone is clearly having a lot fun      Landmark with Invisible Hand     7 10     Operation Fortune  Ruse de Guerre     7 10    To Catch A Killer     7 10   A really harrowing mass murder beginning sets the tone for a solid seedy crime procedural  Shailene Woodley   Ben Mendelsohn were a good pairing  It reminded me a bit of True Detective    Persian Lessons     7 10     I Wanna Dance With Somebody     7 10    The Starling Girl     7 10    Return to Seoul     7 10    Lee     7 10    God Is A Bullet     7 10    Some parts were outrageously violent gory and that kept me interested  but it was to long and should have ended 8 times at least  I d love to know how a movie like this gets funded  but I m not complaining      Wicked Little Letters     7 10     Drift     7 10    The Other Laurens     7 10    Wonka     7 10    Manodrome     7 10    Nyad     7 10    Other than the perfectly intertwined documentary footage woven into the movie  which I loved   it s a pretty safe and cliche sports biopic  An excuse for Annette Benning to make faces  It was okay      The Flash     7 10     The Animal Kingdom     7 10    Flamin  Hot     7 10    You could tell it took a lot of liberties but it s such an uplifting and fun story that it can be overlooked      Joy Ride     7 10    Strange Way of Life     7 10    I enjoyed the hopeful ending and the two lead performances  but did not like the bad dialogue  explaining exposition   This is a short but I watched it as a double feature with another Almodovar short  The Human Voice  see  much lower down this list      Blue Beetle     7 10    Knock at the Cabin     7 10    Robot Dreams     7 10    Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars     7 10    Good music  not so good camerawork  I want to see the show  not audience face closeups      The Punishment     7 10       Bunker     7 10       When You Finish Saving the World     7 10    Fool s Paradise     7 10    A warmly endearing performance from Charlie Day mixed with an amazing score from Jon Brion and a few hilarious cameo roles  Glenn Howerton  Jason Bateman   brought down a bit by a lot of wacky plot turns  awful pacing  and some terrible cameos  Common  John Malkovich   Overall  I liked it      A Thousand and One     7 10     Paint     7 10    What s Love Got To Do With It      7 10    I love Lily James  Sue me      Simon     7 10    Hard Miles     7 10    Along Came Love     7 10    Smoking Tigers     7 10     Juniper     7 10     No Bears     7 10    Bittersweet movie for me because it was the last movie I watched at one of my favorite independent theaters before they shut down permanently       Missing     7 10    Two Tickets to Greece     7 10    The ultimate Wine Mom Movie      Path of the Panther     7 10     All the Beauty and the Bloodshed     7 10    There s 2 stories here  and they re both interesting and worth telling  but I can t help to feel as if they would ve been more effective as 2 different documentaries       Turn Every Page     7 10    Earth Mama     7 10    Anyone But You      6 10    Powell and Sweeney had great chemistry  There s some clunky dialogue and awkward pauses  but overall it was a fine rom com  I went in expecting Hot Rich People Go On Vacation  The Movie  and that s exactly what I got  Also  if going forward every movie could end with a full cast kareoke montage of Natasha Beddingfield s Unwritten  that d be awesome thanks      Transformers  Rise of the Beasts     6 10    I saw this at a Regal 4DX  It was 2 hours of the seat shaking violently  water being sprayed in my face  blinding flashing lights in the corner of my eyes  and my feet being whipped by some broom like contraption  2 10 would not recommend  The movie itself was okay  Not as good as Bumblebee  not as bad as Michael Bayformers      Next Goal Wins     6 10    The New Boy     6 10    Indiana Jones  The Dial of Destiny     6 10    Gran Turismo     6 10    It s filled to the brim with product placement  has a really cheesy first 30 minutes  Orlando Bloom is hilariously bad  and it s got every gamer racing movie cliche  but all that being said it was better than I expected  Bit of a surprising  kinda seat clenching scene at the halfway point and a thrilling last 20 minutes keep it afloat      Nandor Fodor and the Talking Mongoose     6 10     Plane     6 10    The Little Mermaid     6 10    Chevalier     6 10    Dreamin  Wild     6 10    It was actually a pretty solid family music drama with great performances and good songs until the very last scene  It takes a wild swing there and just completely misses      Susie Searches     6 10    Fallen Leaves     6 10    Elemental     6 10    65     6 10    Finestkind     6 10    Chile  76     6 10    Cocaine Bear     6 10    It was very clunky and not as funny as it should have been  Some very dry awkward editing made it feel very disjointed  Okay score for the brutal death scenes and a few funny moments      M3GAN     6 10    Daddio     6 10    Gonzo Girl     6 10    Solid first half  and Willem Dafoe Camilla Morrone are great throughout  but the second half is too repetitive  We get it  Hunter S Thompson did a lot of drugs  I m not a fan of Ray Nicholson in general  but I thought he was distractingly bad in this  Willem Dafoe surprised the audience and showed up for this so that was really cool      Thanksgiving     6 10    Mob Land     6 10    Drugstore June     6 10    American Graffiti    Re Release    6 10    I saw this for the first time because it had a 50th anniversary re release and I can t help but to think it has aged really badly  There s a few good scenes  but I can t really understand how this is widely considered a 70s classic      The Wrath of Becky     6 10    The Lesson     6 10    The Marsh King s Daughter     6 10    You ever watch a movie and think  this was definitely a book before   This was that movie  Daisy Ridley and Ben Mendehlson made it kinda watchable      The Critic     6 10    Kandahar     6 10    It s a Gerard Butler action pic  You know what you re gonna get  Surprisingly good special effects in this one  a few chuckles  20 minutes too long  confusing plot      Boy Kills World     6 10    No More Bets     6 10    Haute Couture     6 10    Valeria Is Getting Married     6 10    Jules      6 10    Silent Night     6 10    It had a few solid actions scenes  like the hand to hand combat sequence with the Mob Accountant Guy   but it was a very poorly balanced movie  I can t tell if it was purposefully or accidentally funny at times  We did get the world s first ever drive by knifing though  props to that      Jawan     6 10     Golda     6 10     The Boy and the Heron     6 10    Gorgeous visuals and an amazing score brought down by a confusing  boring  and grating story  At the 2 3 point  I just wanted it to end  Nonsense whimsical shit just kept happening for the sake of having nonsense whimsical shit going on      Biosphere     6 10    Renfield     6 10    L Immensita     6 10       The Boys in the Boat     6 10    It s fine if you re in the mood for a safe  predictable  slightly uplifting sports biopic with an underdog story  There s like 438 minutes of rowing montage though  could ve done with a bit less of that      My Happy Ending     6 10    They Called Him Mostly Harmless     6 10     NAGA     6 10    Shortcomings     6 10    Incredibly unlikeable main character with no arch made it hard to connect to this movie      Our Son     6 10    Relax  I m From The Future     6 10    Panda     6 10    This is one of 3 short films on the list  Since I saw it in a theater  with an audience  at a festival  with director actress Q A  I am including it  but it was only 12 minutes      Story Ave     6 10    The Baker     6 10    Spinning Gold     6 10     Monica     6 10     Stay Awake     6 10    Everybody Wants To Be Loved     6 10    Tove     6 10    Migration     6 10      Miranda s Victim     6 10    Of An Age     6 10    Charcoal     6 10     Egghead and Twinkie     6 10    A cute little coming of age  road trip  coming out movie  The acting was pretty rough  it was mostly new actors from a local university I think  and the dialogue had some bad patches  but the fun animated moments made up for most that  Crazy what they were able to do with a  80 000 budget      Radical     6 10     Beau Is Afraid     5 10    First hour  Really digged it  Next 8 hours         what the fuck             Master Gardener     5 10    A whole lot of buildup for almost no payoff  Feels like Paul Schrader remade his own First Reformed but worse in evert way      Magic Mike s Last Dance     5 10    A series of diminishing returns  End it please      The Machine     5 10    Haunted Mansion     5 10    The only actual laugh was the Owen Wilson  this exorcism is going above your heads  bit to the ghosts  Otherwise  totally forgettable and useless remake       The Last Voyage of the Demeter     5 10    The Equalizer 3     5 10     see Magic Mike review      Sympathy for the Devil     5 10    The Marvels     5 10    Pathaan     5 10    Sound of Freedom     5 10    Wildcat     5 10    Maya Hawke really commits to the role but Ethan Hawke s direction is very sloppy and all over the place in this one  The whole cast and Ethan Hawke were there for Q A though  so that made it a fun experience anyway      Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom     5 10    Trolls Band Together     5 10    Marlowe     5 10    At the Gates     5 10    The premise itself was really hard to buy and that made the rest of the movie really hard to commit to      About My Father     5 10    Ruby Gillman  Teenage Kraken     5 10     Wish     5 10    It was just so bland      Fitting In     5 10    I m getting a bit bored with the  this person has a rare disease and things suck  genre      Ant Man 3  Quantumania     5 10    CGI vomit with no heart  The whole franchise needs a hard re evaluation and re set      Last Summer     5 10    Catherine Breillat is known for being extremely provocative with her movies  but this ended up being pretty tame by her standards  Had higher hopes going in  If you re into French talky sex dramas with an almost incest twist  I guess this is for you      Games People Play     5 10    Plan 75     5 10    Slow  confusing  slightly irritating  Looked great though  and I appreciated the story idea  Like a Japanese Greek Weird Wave movie      Shttl     5 10    I felt like an outsider watching this movie  I didn t understand 95  of what the characters were talking about  but the one shot  gimmick  kept me involved      KILL     5 10    Some good brutal bloody kill scenes  but overall an extremely repetitive  overlong  and derivative movie  It s already been made 20 other times  usually in better ways  Watch Snowpiercer or Bullet Train instead      Thank You For Coming     5 10    A Perfect Day for Caribou     5 10    Big George Foreman     5 10    Rimini     5 10    The Mission     5 10    A boring documentary about a religious fanatic doing something wildly stupid      Gringa     5 10    Space Oddity     5 10    House Party     5 10    I appreciate how this just randomly turned into Eyes Wide Shut two thirds of the way through      Love Again     5 10    This got savaged by critics but I found it so bat shit insane convoluted that it almost became a bit endearing  kind of like that crazy ass rom com a couple years ago starring Emilia Clarke  Last Christmas       Sunnyland     5 10    The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck     5 10     Where Life Begins     5 10     Jesus Revolution     5 10    Artist Unknown     5 10     Divinity     4 10    I am confusion      A Man Called Otto     4 10    Sure  it gets a few tears at the end  but it feels very emotionally manipulative  A really sweet   funny turn from Mariana Trevi o though  she alone keeps this somewhat watchable  I d recommend sticking with the original      Champions     4 10    North Star     4 10    Like a modern day Downton Abbey  but with less warmth and charm   Carried by decent performances all around  Scarlett doing a British accent was interesting  but the melodrama got too intense  The problems drama are an contrived and overblown      Fast X     4 10    Meg 2  The Trench     4 10     Five Nights at Freddy s     4 10     Origin     4 10    A sloppy bloated tearjerky documentary masquerading as a

1akzai9kpbfgeo,1akzai9,kpbfgeo,giulioangelino,2024-02-07 11:28:57 UTC,,, Is this the case  Or will people  generally  not go to the cinema for a mid budget film as they don t see it as an added value over watching it on streaming a month or two down the line  A comedy like Bottoms  or something like Priscilla or Eileen   is it easy to convince people to spend money to watch them when the experience will be broadly the same on their TV at home         Went to the cinema to see Saltburn  and other than my friend   I  there were only a handful of people in the screening  I get the idea it didn t do particularly well at the box office  but I haven t checked  Amazon Prime release it  though  and suddenly it was massively discussed and I knew so many people that ended up seeing it over the festive period  Can marketing recreate that  or is it a combination of going viral  being easy to watch on your sofa  and not risking a potentially expensive night out to see a film you may not like         Personally I go to the cinema a fair amount  maybe 35 40 times a year  and will always watch on the big screen if I have a chance  I can recognise that these days I m an outlier  the question is why  I feel like the ship sailed for most mid budget theatrical releases when the streaming release turnaround was so drastically cut down   Ok  so I don t want to be the Saul Goodman of the situation but I take your examples to explain my point of view   1  Eileen is a classic example of a low budget film advertised very little and by very little I mean that if you don t follow Neon Rated on social media you definitely don t even know it exists  I m not saying that if advertised more it would have become a success  but it certainly wouldn t have grossed 1 million miserably   Bottoms actually had more success on streaming  but since the target audience was teenagers and it s also a comedy with an LGBT target audience  the circle narrows  It doesn t help that having such a narrow target audience  the film was distributed exclusively in the USA and UK   Priscilla on the other hand  in my opinion  is the example that sometimes the theme of the film isn t that appealing and in any case it grossed 20 million in the USA alone  which isn t too bad   As for Saltburn  the film s virality began right when it was released but after a week where it was projected at 1 500 theaters  Amazon drastically removed Saltburn from theaters and projected the growing success onto its streaming service  If it was maintained a little more in theaters it would have grossed much more in my opinion  It certainly wouldn t have made 100 million domestic  even seeing the type of movie  but if they had kept it in theaters it would have become a mini sleeper hit  And giving you other examples  films like Anyone But You are doing great in theaters when it s a classic film that the cinema doesn t give you added value   Films like The Beekeeper  which as much as I hate this type of film  is a classic mid budget action film that is doing reasonably well and is now on 122 million worldwide   I leave you this article which in my opinion fully takes my point of view and explains it with more suitable words https   variety com 2024 film columns is streaming becoming a form of stockholm syndrome anyone but you 1235896638 ,Discussion,The Beekeeper,0.5919046998023987

1gwxxy1lydj2c9,1gwxxy1,lydj2c9,strykerx,2024-11-22 06:04:36 UTC,,,Wicked had large shoes to fill  The Broadway show is largely hyped up as one of the best and there is so much that could have gone wrong when making a movie adaptation  cough  Cats   But Wicked knocks it out of the park    The world is beautifully crafted  avoiding the typical green screen overreliance  and they didn t just throw the actors on set and rely on overworked VFX artists to fix it in post  Everything was so colorful and whimsical and it hearkened to both the beautiful set designs of the play and also the classic Wizard of Oz   Along with that the camera work and cinematography was stellar and kept things interesting throughout the movie   The cast was phenomenal  I don t think there was a single miscast  I don t know why I always seem to underestimate Ariana Grande  Like when she was on SNL I was like  this is gonna be mediocre  but it ended up being one the best episodes of the season  And when I saw that she was cast for Glinda  I was like  she can sing  but it s gonna be a mess  but then she ended up stealing the show  until the last bit   I could tell how good she was going to be from the first scene when she sees the munchkins wheel out a Wicked Witch of the West effigy and the slight emotional look that comes across her face was really striking when you know the backstory  She was so good and remained likable and funny even when she is being horrible   But I also have to mention Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba  She had such a strong presence and then her number at the end was so freaking powerful    The music was stellar  They really held their ground with the quality of the Broadway show   and the changes that were made didn t ruin anything  I don t know if there is a version of a song from the movie that I like better than the original Broadway cast recording  but there isn t one that I really dislike more either  The choreography was also really good with Dancing Through Life being my favorite and one of my favorite set pieces   I was also impressed on how the 2 5hrs flew by   I went to a late showing  and notoriously have a hard time staying awake when it s past my bedtime  I fell asleep during the action sequences of the first Dune at a late night viewing  but I didn t struggle at all  Didn t feel like it dragged one bit    Great great film 9 10,Official Discussion,Wicked,0.7783342599868774
